For context I work at an auto body shop and my job is to just wash the cars, I finished all the cars and stuff I had to do today so I was just sitting and waiting for them to bring me another key or car. It’s my third week here and everyday is more or less the same, not much work and after I finish everything I just chill unless they want me to do something else and I even asked my boss multiple times before am I doing everything as I should and she said I’m fine (it felt weird to me sitting down doing nothing sometimes when I first started) , idk nothing was different today  so I don’t understand. Can someone help me out on why she would say this. ",
