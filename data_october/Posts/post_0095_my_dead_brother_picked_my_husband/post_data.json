  "selftext": "My brother died when he was 16 and I was 15. He had a rare infection no one knew to test for, it travelled to his heart and he slept away peacefully. When large things happen in life it’s hard to accept that he isn’t here for them \nIt’s been 15 years since he died. I’ve dreamed about him a few times but it’s always just been a passing glance.\nThe week before my wedding I had a dream that he hadn’t died, that he had been incarcerated with a life sentence and we could only see him once every 15 years. My fiancé at the time wasn’t able to come to the prison to meet him and I was absolutely distraught because I wanted him to meet my husband so badly. At the very end of the visit he grabbed my hand and said “don’t doubt Dom, I picked him special for you. I thought you’d notice by the birthdays”. And I woke up. It was the most realistic dream I’ve ever hard. I remember it so vividly and to this day I can feel his presence when I think of the dream. My husband and I have been together for 7 years and I never noticed that his birthday is the opposite of my brothers. I mentioned this in my wedding speech a week later. \nBrother’s is 3/9 and my husband’s is 9/3.\n\n",
