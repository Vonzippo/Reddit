I teach science, and this was said in science class. Here soon is our lesson on hurricanes, so they will understand how they form then. For now, I explained that we could not make (let alone control) hurricanes. I'm quite sure there will be a complaint lodged because I'm a liberal or something. I already had one complaint a few years back for saying that masks and vaccines work.",
