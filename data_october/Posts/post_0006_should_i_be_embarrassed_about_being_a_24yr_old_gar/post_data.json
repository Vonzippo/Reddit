  "selftext": "I’m a 24yr old guy, I knew I was never going to college so I went to truck driving school. I’ve been a garbage man for the past 2 years and I feel a sense of embarrassment doing it. It’s a solid job, great benefits and I currently make $24 an hour. I could see myself doing this job for a long time. However whenever someone asks me what I do for work I feel embarrassed. Should I feel this way? ",
