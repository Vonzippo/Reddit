  "selftext": "My worst fear occurred on Tuesday. Our school police officer left his gun in a student restroom. Three students went in after him, the fourth alerted a teacher.\nI have no words for the horror I feel. I am thankful the student who found the gun did not touch it. These are high school students.\nThe legal fallout is happening now. I have no idea what will happen next. ",
