  "selftext": "Every spring for the past few years, my garden has been mysteriously thriving even though I'm honestly terrible at maintaining it during winter. Today I woke up early and caught my elderly neighbor quietly spreading coffee grounds and eggshells around my plants at 6AM apparently she's been doing this all along!When I asked her about it, she just smiled and said \"Every morning I drink my coffee and make my eggs, and your garden looks like it could use them more than my trash can.\" I'm honestly touched. She refused to let me pay her back and just asked me to share some tomatoes when they grow.Sometimes the world gives you these little moments that restore your faith in people. Anyone else discover unexpected kindness in their neighborhood?",
