What strikes me the most is the decline in student writing and comprehension skills that is among the worst I've ever encountered. These are SHARP declines; I recently assigned a reading exam and I had numerous students inquire if it's open book (?!), and I had to tell them that no, it isn't... \n\nMy students don't read. They expect to be able to submit assignments more than once. They were shocked at essay grades and asked if they could resubmit for higher grades. I told them, also, no. They were very surprised. \n\nTo all K-12 teachers who have gone through unfair admin demanding for higher grades, who have suffered parents screaming and yelling at them because their student didn't perform well on an exam: I'm sorry. I work on the university level so that I wouldn't have to deal with parents and I don't. If students fail-- and they do-- I simply don't care. At all. I don't feel a pang of disappointment when they perform at a lower level and I keep the standard high because I expect them to rise to the occasion. What's mind-boggling is that students DON'T EVEN TRY. At this, I also don't care-- I don't get paid that great-- but it still saddens me. Students used to be determined and the standard of learning used to be much higher. I'm sorry if you were punished for keeping your standards high. None of this is fair and the students are suffering tremendously for it. ",

An older gentleman approached me and asked what I was reading. We had a brief but lovely chat about books.The next week, I was there again with a different book. The same man showed up, this time with his own book. We nodded at each other, smiled, and went back to our reading.Week three: I arrive to find the man already there. He's brought a friend. They're both reading silently. I join them at their table, and we all read in comfortable silence for an [hour.Fast](http://hour.Fast) forward to yesterday. I walk into the coffee shop, and there are TWELVE people scattered around, all silently reading books. The barista grins at me and says, \"Your club is getting pretty popular!\"Apparently, word had spread about the \"Silent Book Club\" that meets every Wednesday at 4 PM. People just show up, read whatever they want, and occasionally chat during coffee refill breaks.I've accidentally created the most introvert-friendly book club ever, and I'm happy about it.Has anyone else ever started something unintentionally that took on a life of its own?",

But the people are just different, you‚Äôre so tribal, you support high school gridiron football teams? University sports are televised? Adverts are everywhere? The American dream is a real thing people are inspired by?\n\nI was just full of questions about his way of life, he was telling me about thanksgiving which I knew about from the Simpson‚Äôs and honestly I wish we had that here because I love turkey.

    "selftext": "My kids were over last night. My daughter lost her husband 7 years ago to suicide. My girls are 34,33, and 29.\n\nOldest we'll call Ashley, middle we'll call Mary (of course)\n\nAshley and Mary joke a lot. Mary and I had a long talk and she has decided to not date and remain abstenent in her second life. She has 2 kids, and a kind of mean sense of humor.Ashley is divorced with no children. She jokes too but her jokes can also come across harsh.\n\nSo anyway, last night. They were joking and Mary said something along the lines of \"it's the uneven eyebrows for me\" and Ashley said \"it's the dead husband for me\"\n\nMary did not laugh. She just straight face sat there and turned and watched the tv. Then Ashley was like \"oh wow you can dish it out but you can't take it\" and they sat in silence. \n\nI left the room to keep fixing dinner but I came back to a shouting match between them. My youngest was trying to calm them down but finally Ashley said \"No wonder ____ shot himself if he was hearing this shit every day\"\n\nMary looked at Ashley for a few seconds and then took off her wedding ring, placed it on the end table by where she was standing, and grabbed her hair and started beating the crap out of her. Ashley fought back but couldn't do much since her hair wss being pulled down. \n\nI was in shock, but part of me, as horrible as it sounds, felt like she kind of deserved it. Like their Nana said \"you play with the match , you just might just start a fire\"\n\nFinally it was getting bad, my youngest was pulling her off and I also started pulling her off. Ashley had a Stanley cup that was now on the ground. When we pulled Mary off Ashley got up. Mary grabbed the Stanley and threw it at Ashley's forehead. \n\nAshley fell down and laid there for a minute. She was conscious, but it took her a few seconds. \n\nHer sister took her to the doctors this morning, she has a concussion, I'll be taking care of her for a while but... that's kind of what happens.",

After this, the house will be fully usable. I am so tired of showering with cold water, outside with a garden hose. Next i will do the kitchen. \nOther than having a cousin help lifting a concrete beam and my mom and partner help moving debree, i did everything by myself. I am normally very not proud of myself, but currently i am a bit. Just hope i have the mental strength to finish it. I cannot believe my partner went along.\n",

    "selftext": "My (now ex) girlfriend and I met and started dating early 2022. I always felt on my guard with her because she was a 10\\10 and I couldn't figure out why she decided to date me, let alone be in a relationship with me for a year. We went long distance in 2023 because she got a great opportunity to go to Europe for work on a 1 year contract. It was huge money and an opportunity for her to travel, but I couldn't afford to go.\nWe video chatted regularly, talked throughout the day by text and things seemed manageable a few months in. I started feeling anxious because she mentioned a guy she worked with who always hit on her, but she assured me nothing would happen and she really missed me.\n\nOne week, she didn't answer and left me on read for two weeks. I finally asked if she was okay and if something happened. She finally answered and said that she had made a mistake and didn't know how to tell me. She wound up going out with that coworker and slept with him. She told me the sex was \"completely shitty\" and described a few things and how it made it so weird. Things I wish I didn't know. Imtold her I was really hurt because she promised nothing would happen and we were still in a relationship. She said she understood she hurt me and it was hard for me but she chose to be honest. She said she needed some space to sort out everything, and it felt like she wanted me to feel bad for her.\n\nA month went by. I reached out once and she left me on read. One month became two, then three. I gave up. I went to therapy after a few weeks cause I was so devastated. I had gone to this therapist after I got out of college at 18, so it's been helpful. But I just wrote off the relationship and decided it was time to move on. I felt angry at first, thought about sleeping with one of my coworkers or friends. But I never did.\n\nAfter 4 months, i asked out the girl who had been my stylist for almost a year. She was super sweet and always subtly flirted with me. We went out and it was just a breath of fresh air. She was very beautiful and kind and we talked so easily and had a great time with each other. We went on 5 or so dates before we said we were a thing. I told her about what happened with my ex and I considered it over and in the past but I had some trust issues and she understood. Her ex did cheated on her too a few years prior.\n\nIt's been almost 6 months since my ex cheated on me. My new girlfriend met my parents and I met her mom. Things have gone very well, and I can't explain everything has been just easy, less anxious and fun. We had a family party at my parents place this last weekend. I decided to post some photos to my Instagram of me and her doing some of the games and just a photo of us together. \n\nI woke up the next morning to a flood of angry texts from my ex. For \"abandoning our relationship\" and not being man enough to tell her it was over and I had moved on. I blocked her number, and then she continued on Instagram and even emailed. Finally I responded saying she didn't deserve to be mad, she cheated and turned her back on everything. She and the relationship was dead to me and she needed to live with what she did.\n\nShe also messaged my new girlfriend. Some nasty things about how how she looked, how we were together and she couldn't replace her. My girlfriend was upset with her but didn't take it to heart. She also blocked my ex and we've just been trying to proceed as normal. But my ex's friends have also messaged me as the bad guy. \n\nI don't feel like this is something I need to answer for",

A pause. Then:  \n\"Are you fucking kidding me?!\"  \nWalks out\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, a message gets sent out via Slack stating that she is fucking done with this school. She is tired of busting her ass for students that just talk over her, sending students out for disrupting class just to have them sent back, lack of support, having to cover other subject's classes, and everything else that is going on in high schools currently. \n\nThe kicker? She was a great first year teacher. She made most of the students actually interested in science. With her departure today, that marks 8 gone since we started in August: 1 PE teacher, 3 English teachers, 2 math teachers, 1 science teacher, aaaand one principal and we are not even done with Q1 yet...",

I‚Äôve dreamed about him a few times but it‚Äôs always just been a passing glance.\nThe week before my wedding I had a dream that he hadn‚Äôt died, that he had been incarcerated with a life sentence and we could only see him once every 15 years. My fianc√© at the time wasn‚Äôt able to come to the prison to meet him and I was absolutely distraught because I wanted him to meet my husband so badly. At the very end of the visit he grabbed my hand and said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt doubt Dom, I picked him special for you. I thought you‚Äôd notice by the birthdays‚Äù. And I woke up. It was the most realistic dream I‚Äôve ever hard. I remember it so vividly and to this day I can feel his presence when I think of the dream. My husband and I have been together for 7 years and I never noticed that his birthday is the opposite of my brothers. I mentioned this in my wedding speech a week later. \nBrother‚Äôs is 3/9 and my husband‚Äôs is 9/3.\n\n",

I started leaving small, wrapped gifts in random spots around my neighborhood - nothing expensive, just little trinkets or handmade items.Each gift has a tag that says, \"A surprise for you! Open me :)\" and inside, there's a note encouraging the finder to either keep the gift if it brings them joy or pass it on to someone who might need a smile.\n\nThe results have been amazing:\n\n1. I've seen people's faces light up when they find a gift. There's this moment of childlike wonder that's beautiful to witness.\n2. Our neighborhood Facebook group is buzzing with posts about these \"mystery gifts.\" People are sharing photos and stories about where they found them.\n3. Some folks have started adding to the gifts before passing them on. A small notebook I left now has encouraging messages from multiple people.\n4. I overheard two elderly neighbors bonding over their \"gift-finding adventures\" while taking walks.\n5. A local coffee shop has set up a \"Kindness Corner\" where people can leave or take small gifts, inspired by this trend.\n\nThe best part? I've noticed others starting to leave gifts too. It's like this little ripple of kindness is spreading through our community.It's reminded me how small acts can make a big difference. Has anyone else tried something like this?",

All this time I thought I was just the guy who cleans up spilled milk and mops floors, but in this kid's eyes, I'm literally saving the world every day.The drawing is now hanging in my cleaning supply closet, right next to my \"super mop of doom.\" Every time I see it, it reminds me that even the most ordinary jobs can mean the world to someone.Anyone else ever have a moment where a kid's perspective completely changed how you saw yourself?",

The diamond ring i bought for her was lab grown, $2400. \n\nA few days after the proposal, everything seemed fine until she somehow discovered the price of the ring. She told me she felt hurt that I would spend so little on her, claiming it reflected her worth and the seriousness of our future marriage. When I asked what she had expected, she said the ring should have been at least $20,000. Granted, I sat her down and explained that, while I could certainly afford a more expensive ring, we needed to manage expectations. There‚Äôs also a wedding to plan, and we might be covering most of the costs ourselves since neither of our parents has the means to help.\n\nI pointed out that there are smarter ways to use $20,000: paying off a car loan, putting it toward a down payment on a house, investing, or even funding her business idea‚Äîsomething we had talked about before. As someone who didn‚Äôt grow up with financial stability, becoming financially secure and literate is a priority for me. But despite the conversation, she insisted she would still feel bothered if I didn‚Äôt upgrade the ring.\n\nGentlemen: the price of a diamond ring should never dictate the quality of your marriage. I‚Äôve been a supportive and committed partner (otherwise, she wouldn‚Äôt have accepted my proposal). Her response shocked me, and after a lot of reflection, I ultimately decided to end our relationship. These past few days have been rough, full of emotions and reactions from loved ones and friends, but I chose to trust my gut on this one.\n\nWe clearly have different values, and I realized this isn‚Äôt the kind of marriage I want. It hurts‚ÄîI won‚Äôt lie‚Äîbut a price tag on a shiny mineral shouldn‚Äôt define the foundation of a partnership.",

I absolutely hate my son. And no, this isn‚Äôt just me being upset over some typical teenage rebellion or an argument gone too far. He‚Äôs 21 now, and I can confidently say he is just a terrible person.\n\nIt started young. He was always the kid who picked on others. I‚Äôll never forget when he broke a classmate‚Äôs arm on the playground in 3rd grade. *On purpose.* The school had to get involved, and even then, he just didn‚Äôt care. No remorse. No apology. I thought it was just a phase or something he'd grow out of, but it only got worse.\n\nFast forward to his teenage years‚Äîhe started stealing. Not just little things like a few bucks from my wallet, but serious stuff. Last year, he somehow got into our bank account and drained our savings. Thousands of dollars, gone, and he used it all on drinking, gambling, and who knows what else. We found out when the bank called us about suspicious activity, and when I confronted him, he just shrugged. No apology, no explanation. He didn‚Äôt even try to deny it. He just *doesn‚Äôt care.* \n\nHe‚Äôs cheated on every girl he‚Äôs ever dated and then has the audacity to laugh about it like it's some kind of joke. He disrespects everyone around him. When he doesn‚Äôt get his way, he throws tantrums‚Äîhe‚Äôs punched holes in the walls, smashed things in the house, and once even threatened to hit me. I‚Äôve had to walk on eggshells in my own home for years now, just waiting for the next explosion. His presence is like this dark, toxic cloud that sucks the life out of everyone.\n\nWe‚Äôve tried everything‚Äîtherapy, family interventions, tough love, soft love, everything. None of it has worked. At this point, I‚Äôm exhausted. I don‚Äôt even recognize him anymore, and honestly, I don‚Äôt want him around. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this, but it‚Äôs the truth: I don‚Äôt want anything to do with him anymore. I‚Äôm just... done. I don‚Äôt feel guilty about it either, not anymore. You can‚Äôt fix someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be fixed.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** My 21-year-old son is manipulative, violent, and has no empathy. He‚Äôs stolen from us, drained our savings, and shows no remorse for any of it. I‚Äôm tired, and I don‚Äôt want him in my life anymore. I don‚Äôt feel guilty about it.\n",

Although he was my boss, we were incredible friends the entire 5 years I worked with him. We had gotten so close and he never made a move until I got transferred to a different location, but I brushed off that random night because he was very drunk. \n\nFast forward to our catch up lunch, and I could see how he was purposely trying to get me drunk and go back to his place. I was young, had lost 40 pounds, and was typically a light weight as it is so I was very surprised the drinks weren‚Äôt hitting me as hard as they were hitting him. But I wasn‚Äôt complaining because I didn‚Äôt want to drink honestly, but I was having trouble saying no. When we got to the last drink, I told the waitress that I didn‚Äôt want another one and he was being incredibly pushy. After us going back and forth a few times, I gave in and she came and brought it to me. I realized, however, that it was mainly just juice. By this point I was frustrated with my friend and wanted to leave so I didn‚Äôt tell her anything, I paid and left. \n\nI won‚Äôt go into detail, but my friend definitely tried to make more moves and got increasingly aggressive when I didn‚Äôt accept his advances and it ended up being a big thing. I‚Äôm realizing now that I probably looked very uncomfortable the entire time and that random waitress was looking out for me, which makes me feel so seen as a person. ",

Throwaway account for obvious privacy reasons, this is by far the craziest thing I‚Äôve done and I can‚Äôt believe I suffered all these years staying with this man just so I can survive financially\n\nThe start of our marriage was wonderful. We had two babies. After the second pregnancy he cheated on me with a very close family member. He gave me a lazy apology and on top of that he complained about my body. He also told me I was built like a refrigerator mind you I was four months postpartum at the time.  I secretly saw a family lawyer, to sum it up for you I would be screwed leaving him. We only had $25k jointed and that being split up is basically nothing for me. No martial properties. I didn‚Äôt have a job. I was a SAHM. I applied for hundreds of jobs during the time and couldn‚Äôt find employment anywhere so leaving was a bad decision for me financially speaking especially with 2 small babies. Also, alimony and child support wasn‚Äôt going to be enough for me to live off of or survive with two babies with \n\nSo I let him believe that I forgave him and I continued being his wife\n\nHe still cheated on me after I found out he cheated on me with my cousin. He also had a one night stand with a random girl he met when he was out one night. I got so mad, I cheated back on him out of anger, he never found out I cheated though at least I‚Äôm smart about it unlike him\n\nDuring the time in our marriage, I worked on getting my independence back. My husband paid for my trade school it was a very expensive program but he paid for everything\n\nWe moved and we bought a house with his income. He grew his money too during all this time. So he made far more money now than he did when I originally wanted to leave him. I started working just 2 weeks ago. I haven‚Äôt filed for divorce yet. He has no idea of my plans. I‚Äôm excited. I finally get to leave him after 6 almost 7 years. Now I can walk away with at least $200k and we have martial assets now like the house and the car he also paid off for me. Now I have my education and my own career. I been working on my weight loss. I lost 66 pounds he paid for my tirezepatide. I had a breast reduction and a breast lift. I look amazing, I don‚Äôt doubt I‚Äôll probably get remarried eventually. Everything in my life is FINALLY set and going the right way ",

I own makeup from Charlotte Tilbury, Rare Beauty, Dior, and YSL. I have always had a closet full of clothes. I own thousands of dollars worth of clothes and makeup. I also have a lot of expensive jewelry. I literally have everything I want and more. I gossip about people, spread rumors, and make fun of what they're wearing. I sometimes try to make my friends look bad in front of others just because I can.\n\nI came to this realization after we did a class project where we had to read to kids from an elementary school. When I walked into the class (it was a public school), I read the book Have You Filled a Bucket Today? by Carol McCloud. The book is about filling people's buckets with happiness and not dipping into others' buckets. Afterward, we discussed the book. I asked, \"Can anyone share a time when someone dipped into your bucket?\" A girl raised her hand and said, \"When my sister came home crying because someone poured milk on her.\" Then I realized she was the sister of a girl I had relentlessly bullied. I had poured milk on her.\n\nAfter that, I went home and cried. I realized how much damage I have done, and I don't know how to repair the harm caused by all the bullying, flaunting my wealth, and acting entitled and superior. I don't know how to reverse it.\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I woke up when I was 12.\n\nWhen I was a child, strange things would happen to me. I was constantly sick with fevers and flus. I feel it's important to preface with this since it could possibly explain some of the things, but not all of them.\n\n I had a small tube TV in the room next to my bedroom, I called it the toy room because I had an easel, desk, casette deck et cetera in there. I repeatedly woke up sitting in a chair in front of my TV, not remembering walking there. It lasted for about a year when I was 5-6.\n\n When I was about 7 years old I remember standing up out of bed and suddenly being in the middle of a field near my house in my underwear in a heavy rain storm. I walked home since it was only a block away and all the doors of my house were locked, I had to knock to be let in. I remember my parents' shock and disbelief. They always denied it happened and seemed to have no memory of it after that night, but when my mom passed in 2019 I read her old journals she left to me and she wrote it down in 2003! They just genuinely didn't seem to remember it even the next day, even til the day she died. My dad still claims not to remember!\n\nAround this time I started having terrible dreams, waking up groaning and crying, unable to remember them. I genuinely felt like there was something coming into my room and putting the dreams into my head. They stopped abruptly one day and I haven't had a single dream since then. \n\nBetween the ages of 8-10 I would frequently have out-of-body experiences where I would see myself from different viewpoints. Sometimes it was like an over-the-shoulder 3rd person perspective, other times it would be a view from above. It was genuinely all I could see, I couldn't see out of my eyes but only through this odd perspective. I thought I would be seen as crazy if I tried to tell anyone so I just kept quiet and tried not to think about it. It happened occasionally as I got older but \n\nFrom 10-12, I have no memories. None. My parents claimed I just kind of stopped talking, stopped interacting with people, stopped doing anything at all. They said I was like a ghost just existing and emotionless, robotic and silent unless asked a question. I failed all of my classes and was nearly put into special Ed.\n\nThen one day when I was about 12 I just.. woke up. No more weird sicknesses, no more sleepwalking (or teleporting I guess?), no more weird dissociating, nightmares, robotic behavior, paranormal experiences, nothing. I started remembering things normally, experiencing normal pre-teen feelings, everything just kind of started being \"okay\".\n\nI don't even know why I'm posting this but it just crossed my mind and felt weird. Any explanations or insights, even just comments or shared experiences would be awesome. Thanks for reading.\n",

Kylie supported me emotionally the entire time through school which I‚Äôm grateful for. Kylie‚Äôs parents ended up cutting her off financially, because of her spending habits. She ended up taking a year off to work to help her with her bills. In the meantime I invested all my savings, time, and energy into a startup platform with my best friend in the automotive industry. Earlier this year we were bought out for a life changing amount of money. We were both kept on as consultants with a high paying salary as well. Kylie had kept her job at the jewelry store this entire time. After the buyout she told me she was handing her 2 weeks in. I offered to pay for her school and expenses. At first she was excited to go back and earn her nursing degree. I ended up purchasing a condo for us to live in (big step up from our apartment) close to her school. Over the weekend we were talking, and she threw out the fact that she wasn‚Äôt sure about wanting to go back to school, and that she could be a stay at home wife (we‚Äôre not married). I didn‚Äôt say anything in the moment because I wasn‚Äôt sure on how to respond. Part of what attracted me to her in the first place was her ambition. It just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me that she quit her job and career goals after I came into money. Her shopping/spending has also gone up. She‚Äôs been looking at new cars. I could be overreacting, but something just doesn‚Äôt seem right. I still love her and want it to work out, but I don‚Äôt like this new side of her I‚Äôm seeing. \n\nThanks in advance ",

That's when I hear a BANG and I thought that this guy hit my dad.\n\nThis primal anger came over me and I quickly exit the car and start yelling at this dude. He was skinny but tall. I was taller than him, I weight 108kg (238lbs) and have been going to the gym for the past year.\n\nThis guy went from trying to fight to immediately backing up as I started charging him while yelling. He started explaining himself to me while walking backwards, like I was his teacher and he was in trouble. Started telling me that my dad swore at his sister and that he was defending her. It was hilarious that he was lying to me because I was right there and my dad never swore.\n\nMy dad ran over and stopped me from going any further and kept telling me to calm down as this guy was walking away from us. \n\nI saw this look of fear in his face when I got out and started yelling. I am a very introverted and peaceful person I don't think I have scared anyone before this point.\n\nThis guy was 100% looking to fight my dad, that bang I heard was him kicking the car door luckily he didn't hit or injure my dad.

I rushed back with \"Not-Max,\" and we had a good laugh about it once we sorted it out. Anyone else have one of those ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this just happened‚Äù moments lately?",

None of them know how obsessed we are with each other, and have been since high school. The frisky, awkward little teens have only gotten more confident and more adventurous over time.

Love your person wholly. Try new things. When the clerk at the sex shop recommends the libido chocolate, brush off the embarassment and give it a try. When your husband makes comments about how good you look, lean into it and ask if he has any requests for later.  Don't stop having fun.

I begged my parents for years to get a hysterectomy done while they had the chance.

Her dental hygiene is so bad that her teeth are falling out in combination with lifelong thumb sucking. Constant kidney infections from poor hygiene downstairs.

I received a call from my husband telling me to come home, and then hung up. He said nothing me. I frantically drove home from work. Upon entering our home, he started yelling at me for being a horrible mother and how dare I not be home, and not answer his calls (I was at work) when he needed me. He then told me that our daughter had fallen. He put her on the kitchen counter, in her car seat, without being strapped in, and walked away for 10 minutes. Even went upstairs, watched tv, played on his phone. In that time, she had wiggled out of her car seat and fell onto the kitchen floor. I was aghast when I heard this. The rage I felt was indescribable. In my fury, I slapped him. \n\nAs soon as I did it, I ran off to our daughter‚Äôs nursery and drove her immediately to the ED to be evaluated. Thankfully she was okay. \n\nNow we are sitting in the aftermath. I am upset and feel my trust has been betrayed. He had been drinking around her all day and that infuriates me. He has had a problem drinking in the past. I thought it was getting better. He, on the other hand, is enraged about the fact I slapped him. I don‚Äôt think physical violence is ever okay and i apologized for it. He‚Äôs hell bent that the slap will be the reason we now get divorced. He says it was all just a mistake and that it won‚Äôt happen again. And he may be right. I really don‚Äôt know if there is any recovery from this. It feels like our marriage is over. Do you think there is any way this can be worked out? We do plan to see a therapist. \n",

    "selftext": "My wife claims she needs to sleep at least 12 hours a day to feel well-rested. This was something that I thought was an exaggeration while we were dating, but after we moved in together I quickly realized was 100% true.\n\nMy wife works a remote job from home, which means that she wakes up at 9am every morning, just barely enough time for breakfast before she clocks in at 9:30. She works 8 hours plus a mandatory 1-hour lunch break (where she speed eats her lunch and goes back to work asap). That means she clocks out at 6:30pm. She makes a point to shower every day, and since she has no time to do it in the morning, she does it after work. That usually means that she's done with everything at around 7:15.\n\nBy this time, I've already arrived home and begun preparing dinner. She usually joins me to give me a hand, and we normally begin eating at around 8. After finishing eating and cleaning up, it's usually about 20 minutes to 9, where my wife will finally decide to partake in one of her hobbies (usually reading), or watch or play something with me. This is the best part of my day. However, this doesn't ever last long enough, since by 9pm my wife will invariably claim she's tired and needs to go to bed.\n\nThis means that I get around 15 to 20 minutes per day of hanging with my wife, which I do not feel is enough.\n\nBut this is only one of the many issues this creates:\n\n- She pressures me to go to bed at the same time she does, claiming it would be weird otherwise for a married couple, and that me not doing so is the reason we don't have much sex. I have tried to disprove her theory by going to bed at 9pm as well and, sure enough, she's always too tired or minutes away from falling fast asleep. We're falling into a dead bedroom and I believe that resentment might be setting in.\n- I get sick if I go to bed that soon after dinner. I have a crappy stomach and my digestion will almost stop if I go to bed after eating a meal. Terrible reflux as well.\n- I just don't want to go to bed at 9, period. 9 is the time of my day where I'm finally free from responsibility and can wind down and do what I want. I don't want to wait for the weekend to be able to do that. I don't want to be miserable for 5 days a week, only to try and squeeze a few hours of fun in-between all the chores that need to be done.\n- About weekends: she keeps her sleep routine. This means that late night outings are out of the question, unless a rare surge of energy happens. There is also not that much time for fun, because the weekend is usually when we tackle the huge backlog of chores that accumulated during the week.\n- About communication: I've tried to communicate to my wife that I *need* to be awake between at least 9-10:30 so I can do stuff I enjoy. I tell her that if she needs sleep, then she at least needs to be okay with the idea that I'll be in the living room doing something else. She has a few strong ideas about this, which leave me frustrated: she believes that there are no such things as night owls and early birds, and that sleep patterns are 100% controllable. She also claims she doesn't need to adjust hers, as she's convinced she sleeps a healthy amount of time and that everyone else should be doing the same as her.\n\n\nI often tell her that she pretty much sleeps and works. That's all she does. She has ADHD and hyper focuses on her work, but her productivity is subpar, meaning she usually takes much longer than normal to complete her tasks (probably due to her struggles with attention). This is a common source of anxiety for her. I also believe she might be burned out, as again, she does nothing else in her awake time but work.\n\nAt this point I'm at a loss on what to do. I just don't want to lose the love of my life and best friend to what I consider an incompatible sleep pattern...",

YouTube tutorials during breaks, online classes after work, practicing in front of my bathroom mirror every night. It's been incredibly hard keeping it from her because we work closely together, but I wanted to wait until I was somewhat decent at it.\n\nToday was her birthday, and when she came in for her shift, I signed \"Happy Birthday! I hope you have a wonderful day\" in FSL.\n\nGuys. The look on her face. She literally dropped her bag. Then she started rapid-firing signs at me with the biggest smile I've ever seen. I had to awkwardly sign \"Sorry, please slow down, I'm still learning!\" She laughed so hard she had tears in her eyes.\n\nWe spent our entire lunch break with her teaching me more signs and telling me about growing up in the Philippines. She said she hasn't been able to properly talk to anyone at work in her native language since moving here, and while she loves ASL, FSL just feels like \"home.\"\n\nShe just texted me saying she called her mom to tell her about it. Her mom apparently cried.\n\nI'm not sharing this to brag - I'm just really happy. It's amazing how something that took just a few hours a week could mean so much to someone. And now I have a new friend who's promised to help me get better at signing!",

    "selftext": "I never thought winning the lottery would be anything other than a dream come true. But here I am, with more money than I ever imagined, and it feels like my life is falling apart.\n\nA few months ago, I bought a lottery ticket on a whim. I almost forgot about it until I saw the numbers on the news. I couldn't believe my eyes‚ÄîI had won $600,000. At first, I was in shock. I called my boyfriend, J, and he rushed over, equally ecstatic. We were both over the moon, dreaming of what we could do with the money.\n\nBut the dream quickly turned into a nightmare.\n\nIt started with J. He began making plans for the money without really consulting me. He wanted to quit his job immediately, buy a luxury car, and invest in risky ventures. When I suggested we take things slow and maybe talk to a financial advisor, he got defensive. He accused me of not trusting him and said I was trying to control everything.\n\nThen my family got involved. My parents, who I‚Äôve always had a strained relationship with, suddenly wanted to reconnect. They started dropping hints about their financial struggles and how they could use some help. My sister, who‚Äôs always been jealous of me, outright demanded a share, saying she deserved it for all the times she ‚Äúsupported‚Äù me. It felt like they were all looking at me differently, like I was just a bank to them now.\n\nJ became more distant and started spending a lot of time with his friends. He‚Äôd come home late, smelling of alcohol, and we‚Äôd argue about his spending habits and his new friends who seemed to only care about our money. The final straw came when he suggested we invest a large sum into a business venture his friend was starting. I said no, wanting to be cautious, and he exploded. He accused me of being selfish and not believing in him. The argument was so intense that he stormed out and didn‚Äôt come back for days.\n\nDuring that time, my family‚Äôs demands became more aggressive. My parents hinted that they were entitled to the money because they raised me. My sister called me greedy and accused me of abandoning my family. I felt trapped and overwhelmed, unable to make anyone happy.\n\nWhen J finally returned, we had a long, painful conversation. I realized that our relationship had become toxic, revolving around money rather than love and mutual respect. We decided to break up. He moved out, taking some money with him as a parting gift, and I felt a mix of relief and sadness.\n\nNow, I'm alone with my fortune, but I‚Äôve never felt poorer. My family is barely speaking to me, and I‚Äôve lost someone I thought I‚Äôd spend my life with. I‚Äôve hired a financial advisor and a therapist to help me navigate this new reality, but the emotional toll is immense.\n\nWinning the lottery was supposed to be a blessing, but it turned into a curse. I wish I could go back to the way things were before, when life was simpler and relationships were genuine. I just needed to get this off my chest.",

There were only two other girls, both maybe 16/17. \n\n\n\nAt some point in the night, I was sitting by the bonfire alone and separated from the group. I noticed one of the girls sitting between two guys and didn‚Äôt think to listen to the conversation until one guy got up and started making a lot of exaggerated gestures towards the other guy who was sitting. I listened and caught on that guy #1 was trying to convince the girl to sleep with guy #2. The girl was protesting in every way. She was slurring her words and moving in slow motion. I was frozen until the guy standing started tugging on her to stand up. The guy sitting started talking about the room they could go to. Every alarm bell in my head was going off. \n\n\n\nI felt a rush of blood drain from my face. Being drunk made the feeling worse I‚Äôm sure. I ran inside to find her friend and told her plainly ‚ÄúYou guys need to go *now*.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt question me, didn‚Äôt say anything, just went outside and got her friend and left. To this day idk how she instantly knew how serious it was but I‚Äôm so thankful she didn‚Äôt brush me off or something. She saved her friend. \n\n\n\nAfterwards, I stayed around a bit to sober up but kept my distance. I was so shaken. I told the guy I was there with what happened and he didn‚Äôt seem to think it was a big deal. Said they‚Äôd known each other since they were kids and it was fine. That ‚Äúthey‚Äôre all drunk.‚Äù She was more drunk than those boys were 100%. I never spoke to any of those people again. ",

    "selftext": "Me (32F) and my husband (32M) have been together for 8 years, married for 5. I am not ashamed to say i was the pretty one in our relationship when we were dating. Before we got married he was around 280lbs and 5'11, didn't know how to choose clothes for himself (he hates shopping) and had a bald head. I fell in love with who he was as a person, eventhough i never cared for his looks i was secretly assured that he wouldn't cheat on me. I was cheated on every single one of my relationships until he came along.\n\nInto 2nd year of our marriage, his sister had to lose ton of weight due to heart issues and he started going to gym with her 5 times a week to support her. I was very supportive of him to start exercising and thought it was very sweet of him to support his sister like that. \n\nWith 2.5 years of hard work they both lost ton of weight. He specifically lost around 100 pounds and turns out he has very blessed genes. I am talking about full on abs and everything. Never knew man can grow jawlines by losing weight.  Even his p\\*nis seemed to bigger. I was very proud of him and was pleasantly suprised by this.\n\nThen soon after he got a promotion at work. He became head of his department and his former boss advised that he should look more \"presentable\" as a representation of their department. My husband took his words to heart and turned to me for help. We went on shopping spree and started to let his hair grow out. Well again, turns out he has a beautiful hair. \n\nBy this time my husband is very attractive man. Then a month, we went to company's anniversary party with his coworkers. I noticed that women at that party was just swooning over my husband and even worse he just doesn't realize it. I learned from his coworker that most single woman even some of the married ones are actively throwing themselves at him at his workplace. There was one younger girl who gave him a kiss on the cheek while WE WERE SITTING TOGETHER.\n\nI talked to him about it and he said \"Well she is french. i thought french people are like that. I guess i'll try to keep my distance from her\". Honestly it was dumb response but it's just so like him. \n\nI don't like how much attention he is getting. I feel like as soon as we get into rought patch (if we get into it) there is ton of women waiting to pray on him. I am scared that some of those woman will affect him as he is pretty naive as a person.\n\nNote that he was eveything i could ask for in marriage and has been great if not perfect husband for me over the years. I feel like such a POS for wishing he stayed physically the same.",

Recently I bought Airpods 4 and I had them on noise cancellation mode (helps me focus)\n\nI heard the loudest and the scariest noise ever, it was like a bomb went off. It was so loud that even the noise cancellation couldn't block it. Then the screams followed. \n\nI live in an apartment right in front of one of the main avenues in my city. My kitchen is on the other side of the house. As soon as I heard the bang and then the screams, I grabbed my keys and ran outside. I had no idea what was going on.\n\nTwo cars have crashed into each other so bad and at such a high speed that one car was literally 200m away from the crash, right in front of my house. I didn't even see the other car. This car didn't have the front at all. It started from the steering wheel basically, nothing in front of that. There were a lot of people, mostly my neighbours who also heard it, no one was getting close to the car though.\n\nThere was a girl standing behind the car in complete shock, screaming at the top of her lungs. I tried to go up to her and calm her down. She couldn't even stand on her feet, 2 guys were holding her up and trying to move her away from the car while she was screaming hysterically. She was the passenger.\n\nNo one dared to go close to the car and I had no idea why, everyone was just standing or helping the girl that was in shock. I got closer and what I saw will probably never leave my mind. The driver was a woman. The fucking airbags didn't deploy. Her head was cracked open. Her body was completely white, yet her face was bloody and she looked dead. I had never seen a dead body before. \n\nMy body froze in one place and I wasn't able to move until the police pushed me away. The ambulance came and took her away pretty soon. I'm pretty sure she was dead, no sign of her being conscious or alive. It would be a miracle if she survives this and I really hope she does. I heard that she has a 3 year old daughter. This happened hours ago and my body is still in shock. I haven't been able to get the picture of that woman out of my head. \n\nTo all the show offs and reckless drivers, PLEASE don't do this to yourself and your family members, hell even strangers.",

I replied ‚ÄúCongratulations. No, thank you.‚Äù I had no feelings for Josh anymore and I‚Äôm even seeing someone else, but I don‚Äôt want to celebrate the wedding of two people who betrayed me. They were insistent. Josh also messaged me via a different number. Some of my friends also tried to convince me to come to the wedding. I firmly said no. Even my mom called me asking if I was going and when I said no, she sounded disappointed but she didn‚Äôt push it. This is all just quite weird to me. Why would you want your ex-girlfriend/ex- best friend, the girl you cheated on, to be part of your wedding party?\n\nThe day before yesterday, Ana‚Äôs parents called me, telling me that they missed me and really hope I could go to the wedding. I firmly said that I would not be going. Her mom berated me, saying that I should let bygones be bygones and that I should be happy for her daughter. I asked her if I cheated with Ana‚Äôs boyfriend and then invited her to the wedding, would she convince Ana to go? She had no answer to this and I hung up.\n\n¬†This is quite getting out of hand because I‚Äôm receiving more than 20-30 calls and texts a day from their friends and family about this wedding. Any advice on how to handle this? Also any insights on why they want me to go to their wedding? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal that they are very insistent.",

Some of you are vindictive. \n\nFirst off, I found a WRAPPER, not an actual used condom, so the suggestion of DNA testing was not useful. \n\nAnd thanks to u/uhidunno27 for the information about getting detailed phone records from Visible. Today at work during some break time I requested a download of  the phone records but it says the request could take up to 45 days. I can‚Äôt wait that long. \n\nI also drove by her work on my lunch break. I don‚Äôt know why or what I expected but her car was there as it normally is. \n\nLots of good advice to track her, get a VAR, look at her phone without her knowing, hire an investigator, a lawyer, etc. \n\nI can‚Äôt deal with this. I am taking the advice a lot of you had and I‚Äôm just going to confront her today when she gets home. As some of you suggested, I plan to just put the condom wrapper on the table in plain sight and watch her body language. \n\nI am so scared and nervous I am almost pissing my pants. I am really starting to expect the worst. For me, if she cheated there is zero chance we will stay married. Zero. I don‚Äôt care what excuses or reasons or whatever she has, I am 100% done. No therapy, no counseling, nothing. \n\nI can‚Äôt believe I am typing this. It makes it seem real. I can‚Äôt imagine her sucking and fucking some other guy (or guys). That‚Äôs an image I could never get out of my head for the rest of my life. \n\nAs far as assets, we don‚Äôt have a lot. We have a pretty nice house that her dad helped us pay for. I‚Äôm happy to let her have it with my fair share and paying back her father. Otherwise is bullshit like 2 cars, some furniture and some decent savings that we have both contributed to so I‚Äôm willing to split 50/50. \n\nThe thought of divorce is burning a pit in my gut. I‚Äôll post again after I confront her. ",

    "selftext": "I'm F(26) and my girlfriend is F(30) and this is a throwaway account. \n\nWe've been in a relationship for about 10 years and we're engaged.\n\nMy girlfriend has always had problems with hygiene and cleaning of the house, she never did domestic activities in childhood/adolescence and in adulthood this behavior strengthened. Since we met, she has never really taken care of her house and countless times I myself spent weekends cleaning and organizing her house over these 10 years.\n\nFor about 3 years she has been dealing with a depressive condition. She has access to medication, psychologist and all the necessary support in her treatment. In addition, I help her financially since the beginning of our relationship, I pay half of her rent, all the bills when we go out together and some more financial help during the month. She has a good job but doesn't know how to handle the money she earns.\n\nLately her house has been a real pigsty, I don't know how she manages to survive this way. There is no surface free of garbage or objects. She doesn't use dishes so she doesn't have to wash, so it's always disposable plates, glasses and cutlery that she simply throws around the house.\n\nThe sheets smell bad, the floor is dirty but the worst was the bathroom.\n\nSomehow she managed to clog the toilet so nothing goes down the drain. The toilet was full of poop last weekend (I didn't know that). Every weekend I go to her house to be with her and on that day I really needed to poop. When I opened the toilet lid I almost threw up my guts, I couldn't sit there. When I went to talk to her about it, she told me that she was doing her needs in plastic bags and that I should do the same.\n\nAnd, well, I had to do it. There was no way to go out and look for a public bathroom or the mall so I had to shit in a plastic bag. It was so disgusting and humiliating and I felt very angry with her.\n\nAfter that, I had to walk down the 13 floors of her apartment to a trash can on the street with my poop bag. I felt tears forming in my eyes and a lump in my throat. I can't take this relationship anymore and I don't know what to do. How can I leave her like this? My girlfriend's depression is ruining my life.",

    "selftext": "I was outside smoking when I saw him booking it down the sidewalk and then his mom a second later running and shouting after him. He couldn't have been more than 4. I don't even know if I had time to think before I was on my feet sprinting down the road in my socks. \n\nI've never been so fucking terrfied in my life. I live on a busy road that breaks off of a highway leading from the border into town, so there's a lot of traffic and a lot of people speeding down the street. There were so many things running through my mind at once, but mainly that if I didn't get to him in time the chances of him being hit were pretty high. I was geniunely trying to mentally prepare myself in case I had to jump in front of a car to save this kid. Suddenly my physical capabilities could be the difference between someone's life and death or at least injury, which I wasn't emotionally prepared for in the slightest. I was scared, but I moved faster than I ever have in my life. I didn't think I was capable of doing that, and I don't think I could do it again unless the circumstances were the same. I'm physically disabled and have a bad leg from an accident from when I was young, so I wasn't confident I could catch him, but I knew that I had to. No matter what I had to catch him. \n\nI caught up to him just as he was about to cross through another road, thankfully he turned around and when he saw me he froze. I think seeing a grown man he didn't know barreling towards him at full speed scared him, and I'm just glad he didn't start running in the other direction. I brought him back to his mom who wasn't far behind and she was almost inconsolable, understandably so. She thanked me profusely and I offered to walk her back to one of her family members who was waiting up ahead. She accepted, and it took everything I had in me to keep my composure until I got back into my own home and I just broke down and cried.\n\nI've had daydreams about saving someones life before, I think everyone does once in awhile. It's much different in reality though. My girlfriend said I was somebodies hero today, but I don't feel like it. I don't feel proud. Maybe I can't because I'd have to acknowledge how dire the situation was. I don't know. I can't stop thinking about what could have happened if I didn't catch up to him. I can't get his moms terrified face out of my head. I can't imagine what she's feeling right now, I just know it's probably worse than whatever I'm dealing with. It feels wrong to take pride in it, when this might be one of the worst days of her life. Maybe I'm being too hard on myself, but this is not something I have ever experienced. I don't even know what I should be feeling, I don't know what the correct response here is. I've gone from being overwhelmed with dread to just feeling numb, detached, and sore. I'd do the same thing again in a heartbeat, but I really hope I never have to again.",

    "selftext": "Last year, my boss killed himself by overdose and put me in his will on the last day that I saw him. \n\nI was completely blindsided by the signs he showed and for a while I believed his suicide was something I could've prevented. \n\nThe days leading up to his death were confusing. He convinced me that he was selling his home and moving away temporarily to another state until he decided what he wanted to do with his life. Of course, I found this strange but I never questioned him since my job was just to help him with personal/executive assistant errands. I packed his belongings in boxes, discarded personal items, gifted a car away, and even made a partnership deal for his large business so it could be in good hands before he left. \n\nI worked with my boss for three years and we developed a friendship. I even looked up to him as a mentor since he was twice my age, owned a multi-million dollar business, and participated in things I aspired to do in my future. I think it's important to mention that I'm in my early 20s and had little to no experience when I began working with him as an assistant. I also struggled growing up in an abusive household which my boss was able to relate to. He and I both struggled with depression and had alcoholic parents. Although he never knew I was depressed. \n\nThe last day I saw him, he put my first name on his will and when I heard about him again I found out he passed away days later after I saw him. \n\nMonths after his passing, the new owner of the company accused me of writing my name on his will so my boss's parents would think negatively of me. My first interaction with my boss's father was over a phone call going over the accusation while he was intoxicated. I wasn't able to go into full extent on how my relationship was with his son but he did say we could eventually meet and that he would support me as family. It's been months since I spoke to my boss's father and am wondering if I should reach out to touch base on things. A part of me does want support from my boss's father but I also think it would be best to leave the situation altogether since this was a complete tragedy for his family. The new owner of the company has faced accusations of mistreating my boss while he was struggling with drug abuse and pressured him into writing her into his will. The situation is complicated and I just wanted to briefly share and maybe get some guidance or perspective from someone else. \n\nThanks for tuning in and I'd be happy to share answer questions or clear things up in the comments.

    "selftext": "I'm actually really heated about this. I spoke to a few people about it, but it's still getting to me so here comes a rant.\n\n\nBackground:\nThis kid was the \"class clown\" but I feel like that term has some positivity attached to it. This kid was obnoxious, plain and simple. Every time he spoke was a distraction but he genuinely thought that it was all in good fun. He spoke through everything, prevented everyone near him from completing work, said ignorant and offensive things constantly, and generally pissed everyone off. It reached the point that his friends had to say, \"you think it's funny but you're really upsetting me,\" and he still thought it was a joke. I yelled at him in a way I've never yelled at a kid and it slid right off of his smooth brain. Every room was made worse by his presence.\n\n\nHe literally only graduated because of our minimum grading policy. At our little graduation ceremony almost no one cheered for him, but the woman who recorded cheered for everyone so on rewatch he genuinely believed that the whole room went crazy. No, it was a single receptionist. He didn't get invited to the senior skip day but he showed up anyways. In short, he was pretty universally disliked but he had no awareness (or was in hardcore denial).\n\n\nThis was all bad and difficult to manage as a teacher, but then he did an unforgivable. He distributed a girl's nudes to the school. This was a student that I had a lot of interactions with in a sport I ran and I have nothing but respect for. An absolutely beautiful soul. And she was underage. And he sent pictures to a ton of people. Because he's trash.\n\n\nHe graduated last year and he came back once a few weeks after.  I said, \"hard pass. I'm not interested. Leave my room,\" which he somehow did not understand so I had to be even more brutally honest (somehow) and even had students yelling at him so he would leave. \n\n\nToday: \nI was running a club after school and we were in the middle of an activity. The door opened and he comes in with this face he always made when he was about to completely derail everything and cause an issue. I just shouted. Not a yell, but the type of forceful projection that you get after a decade of teaching and coaching. \n\n\n\"No!\" The whole room just stopped and took a breath. It was weird but I just couldn't not. \"Turn around! Walk out of my room!\" \n\n\nEvery single kid and teacher in that room knew that this was not a joke, but somehow he was still in a weird fantasy that we were buddies. So I ushered him out the door. He said something, I think it was along the lines of, \"aren't you happy to see me?\" But honestly I couldn't hear much because I was so in my head. I told him that I'm still upset with him for what he did to that student and I'm not happy to see him. He said, \"but me and her are cool.\" I said, \"well me and you are not. Go.\" And walked away. Plus, with his situational awareness, I'm sure she is not \"cool\" that he sent her pictures to a bunch of people who had no business seeing her naked.\n\n\nI went back in the room, apologized to the other students and staff, very lightly explained that he has a history of disrespect and I didn't want to deal with it. I emphasized that it was not professional for me to act like that and it's not something they are likely to see from me again. 90% of the kids know him and exactly who he is, so they were more concerned with making sure that I felt okay and validated which was sweet. We finished our activity and everyone was happy.\n\n\nI have been batting it around how 3.5 hours now. He just... Was the worst. Even really bad behavior kids make sense to me. When they are bad, they know they are bad. But this kid was so out of touch with reality that he couldn't tell how terrible he was. He had rare moments of reflection that would last literally until the end of his sentence and then back to business as usual. I could not find redeemable things. He made me angry in a way that can't be replicated. But he still thought we were cool. \n\n\nIt is infuriating. Being so completely tone deaf is just maddening. Some part of me thinks I'm blowing this out of proportion, but the part of me that dealt with a series of never ending bullshit for years and aches for my hurt student feels like I should have gone 8000% harder. \n\n\nEnd rant.",

I immediately woke her up and asked for an explanation. She admitted she didn‚Äôt know how to tell me, but there‚Äôs a manager at her work with whom she feels a stronger connection. She said he‚Äôs more financially stable and takes better care of himself than I do. They‚Äôve been talking, but she insists nothing physical has happened.\n\nShe confessed she‚Äôs been unhappy with me for a long time and has been thinking about moving out, but her financial situation has stopped her. Just a month ago, we were talking about having a second child, and a few months back, I proposed to her.\n\nI‚Äôm completely devastated.

She had a completely treatable illness as a result of my sister and her husband refusing a RhoGAM shot prenatally. As a result my niece died a slow, painful death over three days, while my sister and her husband refused to seek or provide any medical attention.\n\nThey have had their parental rights permanently terminated for their other 4 children (two of which were born since my niece died). In the last 18 months, they have had two additional children die at birth. I don‚Äôt know if the autopsies can make any conclusions about whether they were stillborn or died after birth like their previous child. But I do know the parents didn‚Äôt call 911, just like with their previous child. \n\nTheir murder trial has been delayed an amazing amount of times due to Covid, and their extremely persistent appeal of every ‚Ä¶ single ‚Ä¶ pretrial motion. But at the same time, the court system has rescheduled multiple times to prioritize pending cases with defendants who were in custody. But those intervening years without a trial and incarceration have allowed my sister and her husband to carry to term and likely murder two additional children. \n\nI do not blame the prosecutor‚Äôs office, as they have been nothing short of exemplary. But I do wish that the court would schedule this trial at a time that works for the prosecutor, with all possible haste. Or at the very least, remand my sister and her husband to jail until the trial occurs. \n\nThe clock is ticking until my sister and her husband don‚Äôt call 911 for another dead baby.",

It turns me off immediately.\n\nIt never ends and it's incredibly loud. I moved in with my parents last year to support them financially without also having to worry about my own bills. My bedroom is across the hall from my step-dad's. If I don't have anything playing on the TV or speaker, I can't even get horny because I'm just worried about my poor dad having to hear it. \n\nShe also (claims to) cum *incredibly* easily. I grope her boob and it sounds like I'm killing a small animal. I know people are sensitive, but I'm just thinking \"girl, there is *no* way you're orgasming from this.\"\n\nOn the bright side, she's into being hard dominated and I'm more of a soft dom. Her noises make me aggressively agitated in a way she enjoys. Which is cool I guess, if I cover her mouth. ",

    "selftext": "For starters, I think that there's a lot of layers to this situation that makes it feel like this has to be the end. My partner and I have been together for over 9 years and honestly, the first 4-5 years were awesome. I had genuinely never felt this way about ANYONE in my life, but things started going south after that. I started to realize that he always had an excuse for not helping me cook or clean the house no matter how much I begged and pleaded for help, he started making me feel like going to see my family was inconveniencing him (he makes snide remarks the whole time and just makes the entire trip miserable to the point of me crying.) I know it might sound dumb, but I've even started having panic attacks because of how bad he makes the holidays. He doesn't attempt to communicate in a healthy way, and it honestly feels like he waits until the very last moment until he'll apologize (if he does.) I've been on the 'last straw' mark for a few years now, but I always end up forgiving him because I mean, I love him. It's kind of like the saying \"when it's great, it's really great but when it's bad, it's really bad.\"\n\nOkay, so now let's move on to a few days ago when he lost his shit in public over a sandwich. We had the same day off, so we decided to run some errands and go to a sandwich shop for lunch afterwards. Honestly, the first half of the day was great, until it was time for lunch. We walked in and (because it was noon) the place was packed and unfortunately, there was only one person working so we had to wait in line for about 20 minutes. Is it frustrating waiting in line that long? Yes, but I tried to make things as positive as I could because I know he gets irritated easily. We kind of overheard the employee tell others in front of us, that some ingredients were either out completely or just had gone bad (it honestly could have been because of the hurricane outage the week before, we didn't get hit horribly but some did lose power but I'm also not 100% sure on what was going on.) Also, for a little backstory, I had an ex that worked at this particular sandwich chain, and he got me onto this sandwich that I've been eating since I was about 18-19 and I introduced it to my current fianc√©, and we just always get the same thing any time we go there. So FINALLY, it's our turn and we get everything started: bread, meat, cheese and throw it in the toaster. She brings it out and I tell her the next ingredient, 'lots of spinach.' She looks at me and breaks the news that the spinach has gone bad. Bummer. But you know, whatever. It's not the end of the world, right? My fianc√© standing next me goes, \"ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?? DUDE FUCK THIS SHIT. SHE DID THIS SHIT ON PURPOSE. WE'RE FUCKING LEAVING. COME ON,\" and then just storms out and leaves me standing in the shop while everyone in the entire place stops and is either watching the situation or is looking uncomfortable. Just think of how you feel when you see a Karen in the wild... but it was MY PARTNER. (I just want to throw this little side note in here, I have EXTREME social anxiety as well and he is absolutely aware of the severity of it.) So, I'm standing there and quietly tell the employee that he's upset, and I think we might just head out and she hits me with a 'nahhh, if you leave... I'm calling the cops.' My anxiety gets even worse, THE COPS WTF. I look at my phone and my partner has texted me \"get that food and we're done.\" The cops AND I'm being broken up with?? I texted him that he left me in a bad situation, and he knows how bad my anxiety is and then the employee hits me with 'I can't believe you would come in here, know that we're low on ingredients and then waste the little that we have.' I mean, she's right though. I was seriously just going to get lettuce instead of spinach but now I'm standing there, being threatened by everyone for something that I didn't even do. I get another text from my partner, 'fuck it, find someone else to come and get you.' Great, I'm now stranded here. I finish building the sandwiches, pay, and try to hide behind my bag of food hoping that he's still there and thankfully, he is. Unfortunately, he decided to take out his anger on me and for like 15 mins straight. The whole ride home this man blamed me, told me that I'm not a 'team player' and that I 'chose my side' while screaming at me at the top of his lungs. I was bawlingggg. I haven't spoken to him in like 3 days. He sent me a text about how sorry he was but I'm feeling fed up with all of it. I also have a family event tomorrow that I guess I can't make because he's got the only vehicle, so I'm going to have to disappoint my family once again. Idk, I'm just stressed out and I'm not sure what to do anymore. If you've made it to the end of this, thank you for just letting me vent and if you have any advice, I would love to hear it. ",

Another student that was slow putting his stuff away heard the other student and said ‚Äúoh I thought you were just waiting for us to quiet down.‚Äù Which I don‚Äôt remember doing since this class is generally a quiet one.\n\nI have a history of epilepsy but haven‚Äôt had a full onset seizure in 5 years and a partial in 4 years. I‚Äôm a brand new teacher out of college, the school nurse knows I have epilepsy in case anything happens and I mentioned to my students week 1 that I have this and what to do in case I have a full onset seizure during class. Funny thing is the person that noticed the seizure is someone who transferred into my class after the first week so she just realized what it was without even knowing I had epilepsy.\n\nJust kind of ranting but is there anything you suggest I should do for the future?",

    "selftext": "He was 22, almost 23 in November. \n\nI noticed something seemed off about 2 months ago and asked him what was going on. It was just us at the house, and he's usually a pretty stoic guy hell he loves to laugh and joke around. I really did not expect him to breakdown crying.\n\nHe talked about how ugly he felt, he felt so undesirable, one thing that stuck with me was him saying he was \"so cold all the time\". It was honestly really fucking hard for me not to cry. I was surprised because I just kind of assumed he had a regular social life yknow? Few good friends, a girl here and there, stuff like that.\n\nI did notice he stopped going out as much a few years ago and he said he had to drop a lot of friends in the name of \"self improvement\" which I did see him improving himself A LOT these past few years and just kinda thought like \"nice, good for him\" but now I'm starting to wonder if he was doing all that in hopes of getting a girl. \n\nThis was all 2 months ago and I was still thinking about it but idk I guess maybe I thought he'd cry it out and kinda move on to the next part of the story or something? I really didn't know. \n\n3 weeks ago my brother was found after hanging himself in his closet and from what I'm told his note mostly just referenced his struggles with dating and his appearance.\n\nI don't understand. He was such a handsome young man, his hair was so full and beautiful with that amazing dark brown color to it, his eyes were so beautiful the way they'd switch between green and blue depending on how the light hit them, his  voice was so pleasant to listen to, he was so funny he'd have you sore the next day from laughing, he was so smart he taught himself so many things he knew so much about history, culture, science, philosophy, always such a quick learner and such an incredibly hard worker. He was always the first to show up and the last to leave at every job he'd had. He was so kind helpful, giving our nieces and nephews $100 for their birthdays, learning how to braid hair for our nieces, always looking out for people who might need help. He was so balanced, strong yet gentle, capable yet humble, beautiful yet modest. He was such a good cook, even if it didn't turn out the best you could tell he cooked with love and passion. He did everything with a passion you very rarely see in people. Hell he even watched movies, read books, and listened to music. I remember as a kid he used to always tear up during movies and at songs. Hell, I remember when we were little and he cried at the end of kill bill 2. He even taught himself ASL (for our cousin in another state) and Japanese to damn near FLUENCY. I wanted to learn Spanish so bad in high school and couldn't get past the first grammar lesson. I was honestly in awe of him for that. This kid liked a challenge too, he'd be taking cold showers, sleeping without a blanket in the winter, doing pushups until he literally couldn't lift his arms, seeing how long he can study for, how much money could he make in a week. I think he liked seeing what he could withstand. He was so sentimental. Always believing everyone had so much intrinsic value and getting so upset when things were unfair\n\nMy family wants me to do the slideshow. I've picked the songs runaway train by soul asylum and yokan by a band called dir en grey (he loved both songs so much always sang or played them). It's so fucking hard looking at the pictures, hearing the melodies or lyrics. I feel like my lungs are bruised from trying to stifle my tears. What hurts even more is that there's less and less pictures of him as the years go on, and looking back, you can really start to see the happiness drain from his eyes, how the hell did we not see it. I can't stop crying for even 10 minutes. I feel like I'm literally suffocating. I just want to scream I'm so angry and sad at the same time. I'm never ever going to see my little brother ever again for the rest of my life.\n\nI just don't understand, he was so beautiful. He wanted children so bad and I know they would've been so incredibly smart, kind, beautiful, and capable. Just like he was. \n\nI love you so much, Luke. ",

She is in her first year of university and somehow she and my brother have gotten together.\n\nI have no idea when they started talking, but I do know that she is way too young and naive to be dating someone like my bro. Ive seen him single handedly destroy other women's lives by infecting them with his lifestyle. Its no coincidence that women he has dated have all either quit their jobs or dropped out of school once they start dating him.\n\nI literally just drove up to her parents home and told her who my brother is, why she doesnt want to date him, what will happen if she dates him, and I finished by telling her that she can do what she wants to do, but just wanted to make sure she was informed before she starts getting more serious with him.\n\nI left and told herits in her best interest not to get involved with him.\n\nI forgot about it and got a text a day later from my parents and my brother, and then the rest of our extended family asking me why I am actively trying to ruin my brothers life when hes trying to \"get back on his feet\".\n\nThey are all angry with me for pushing away a source of happiness for him.\n\nIve seen this exact story play out a million times, he gets this burst of energy where he says hes going to change, and starts getting money and help from family and just blows it all away again because of some kind of health issue, or the job market is bad, or something else.\n\nIs there even a point for me to try and explain to my family?

Everything changed when my husband came home after work, visibly shaken. He sat me down and confessed that he had a child from a one-night stand right before we met. She‚Äôs 12 now, and her mother passed away recently. The kicker? He knew about the child the entire time but kept it a secret because \"he didn't want to lose me.\"\n\nI was devastated but also completely numb. He showed me pictures and emails, proving that he‚Äôs been in touch with the child‚Äôs mother over the years, sending money, and making sure they were okay‚Äîwithout telling me a thing. He‚Äôd never met the girl in person until her mother passed away.\n\nNow, here‚Äôs where it gets even messier: the girl has no other family, and he wants to bring her to live with us permanently. He said he feels it‚Äôs the \"right thing to do.\" I didn‚Äôt know how to respond. One part of me feels like I should be furious, but the other part of me feels like this poor child has lost her mom and needs stability.\n\nWe had a huge fight. I screamed, cried, threw things. He just kept apologizing, saying he thought he was doing what was best. But I can't get past the fact that he hid something so big from me for an entire decade.\n\nWe ended up taking the girl in. She‚Äôs sweet, quiet, and totally innocent in all of this, but I feel like I‚Äôm living someone else‚Äôs life. I see her every day, and all I can think is: my husband lied to me. She has his eyes, his smile, and it‚Äôs like a constant reminder of his betrayal.\n\nMy kids are adjusting, though they‚Äôre confused about why their new \"sister\" appeared out of nowhere. I haven‚Äôt told anyone else‚Äînot my family, not my friends. I feel so ashamed and trapped. I don‚Äôt know if I can stay with him after this, but at the same time, I feel responsible for this girl who had no choice in any of this.\n\nI‚Äôm drowning, and I don‚Äôt know what to do.",

    "selftext": "I (41f) have been married 21 years to my husband (m41) we have several children.one of them was special needs. He was born with a genetic mutation that neither of us carry, it was random chance. He was sick most of his life and I was his primary care giver. He needed nursing home level care, I had a nurse that came to help me a few days a week. My husband--his father-- did not help much at all no matter how much I asked for his help. He was always \"to busy\" or \" to tired\" and complained of back pain. Our son lived 15 years. I carried him, took care of all his needs, did his meds his tube feeding stayed up with him at night ect. I had to take up body building to be strong enough to transfer him to and from his wheelchair or bed or couch or anything because my husband would not help. I suffered back injuries and even had to crawl on the floor at times to meet my son's needs. He still didn't help. He might change a diaper now and then and want a prize for doing so. \nI couldn't divorce him because I could not have a job while also caring for our son. His needs got greater and greater as he got older, by the time he died he was on 6 seizure meds and had several machines he had to use for part of each day. Still, he was a happy joyful child that loved life and was a joy to be around. He was always laughing and playing and very loved by me and his siblings. \nWhen he died we knew it was coming. I was in the hospital with him and he died in my arms, peacefully and not in pain. \nIt was the worst moment of my life \nAn hour after he died my husband started going on about how he wanted to spend my son's life insurance money on an expensive fourwheeler. He decided that because the policy was thru his work and under his name that the money belonged to him. I hated this idea and wanted to put the money towards our house. He spent it. All of it. \nHe knew I didn't want that, and he told everyone that I was \"on hard with it\" and then acted shocked when I screamed and yelled at him for spending the money. He told his family that I \"didn't tell him\" till after, but at this point even his family sees how awful he acted.\nHe never helped take care of our son and then blew all the life insurance money. To make matters worse he tricked one of our adult sons into paying for the cremation (I paid him back immediately when I found out) \nI can't forgive this man. \nI am so angry beyond words.\nI am also financially trapped as I have no work history for the last 21 years. \nI hate this. \n",

No offense, OP, but you should be kinder to them, regardless of gender...\"\n\nPlease don't laugh but my eyes watered immediately. I asked her what she meant and apparently every single dude I'm friends with implied they're sad little underdogs too ugly to get compliments from \"the ladies\". \n\nAfter class I confronted them for such a pitiful lie (assuming they did it to get compliments from the sorority gals) and... well.

    "selftext": "Before I moved to Paris a couple of years ago, I was a normal person. I was pleasant. I wasn't on high alert all the time. \n\nShortly after moving here, my attitude has progressively declined because I have to deal with french people. Unfortunately, I was not able to hang onto my sweet nature, as each encounter with these moody lunatics has made me more and more like them. I am so mad at myself for this demise. \n\nCase in point, they do not know how to walk down the street, they yield for no one - not the elderly or mothers, injured etc - they walk directly into people (and me) everyday, all day long. If I move to the side, I swear they will move to the same side just to play sidewalk chicken. Eventually, I started doing the same shit. If they aren't going to move, I'm not going to either. They don't hold open doors for the next person, etc. It's relentless. The drivers of cars, motorbikes and bicycles are crazy. They have no respect for human life. They will drive so close and fast to people on narrow street sidewalks. They will act like they are going to hit you and I've seen them hit people before. It is unhinged behavior. I want to go ballistic on these people, but I hold myself back 95% of the time. \n\nIn the grocery store, they give zero personal space. If they see someone coming down an aisle, they will not move until the person asks them to. They do not anticipate anyone else's movement and have no consideration for others. Of course, this isn't \\*all\\* french people in Paris, but it is certainly MOST of them. Don't be fooled. They have this reputation for a reason. The generalization of their rudeness is generally true. It is a pervasive cultural issue. They are also obsessed with having their dogs off leash. At least 50% of the dogs I see in Paris are off leash and have no business being off leash, are not properly trained and disturb others. Multiple times, I have gone into restaurants and coffee shops and seen dogs off leash inside these establishments. \n\n  \nAll of this to say, I am mad at myself for letting myself decline into this state where I am matching the energy of these people. I have even become some sort of \"Karen\" and I say things to people in the street like \"Hello!/Bonjour!\" right before they are about to run into me. A car nearly hit my dog in a crosswalk (I had the green) and I absolutely lost my shit, yelling at her through her car window \"You're going to effing kill someone, you psycho!!!\". It's not a harmless mistake.. it is the repetitive nature of not giving a shit about anyone else but themselves. I have started getting onto people with their dogs off leash \"Where is your leash?? Why are you in a cafe with a untrained dog without a leash? Have respect for other people!\"  Aggressive, unsocialized dogs at cafes, growling and lunging towards people and the owner saying in french \"Oh he's nice\" and I'll just be like \"Really??? he seems SUPER DUPER nice, like he needs a muzzle.\" \n\nThey litter. I want to say \"Really? You're going to throw your trash on the ground??\". The men feel comfortable peeing on the street in broad daylight, I want to say \"You're disgusting. Find a bathroom, you lazy loser!!\" \n\n  \nThey do not care. I've gotten in more heated public exchanges here than in the rest of my life, all my years combined and they always push back. They are territorial, egotistical maniacs. There are many french people I adore, one on one, but I do feel almost like I'm going to battle every time I walk down the street. I've never felt this living in any other city, except maybe on occasion when french tourists were around. \n\n  \nThe other day I calmly (and kindly) told a guy.. you cannot ride your motorbike on the sidewalk and a french man came up behind me and told me to shut up. Maybe I am a big ass Karen now but I don't care. Don't ride your motorcycle on a closed, narrow sidewalk just because the road is closed for construction - go around - it's dangerous, you could hid a small child or elderly person... or perfectly healthy adult.. coming around the corner. \n\n  \nThere are so many things I love about living in Paris, but the people and lack of etiquette and sophistication just aren't included in that list.   \n\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I‚Äôm on vacation after working for 7 days a week over the last 4 months. I desperately needed the break. Then, out of nowhere, I get an email with the subject line: Employment Status. I open it, and my stomach just drops. I‚Äôve been terminated. Over email. One week into my 2 week long vacation.\n\nI immediately call my boss, hoping this is some mistake. Spoiler: it‚Äôs not. She tells me this is some corporate way of ‚Äúgetting the truth out of people.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt hiding anything! She just didn‚Äôt believe me or bother investigating further before sending a random termination email while I‚Äôm on vacation.\n\nHere‚Äôs what started all of this: On Wednesday, October 9th, I covered a shift that wasn‚Äôt mine. When I was leaving, I noticed I hadn‚Äôt been clocked in. Normally, I‚Äôd text my co worker to fix it, but this time I used my company laptop to adjust it myself.\n\nThe next day, my boss asked me how I made the edit. I told her the truth‚ÄîI did it. She asked more questions, but I didn‚Äôt think I did anything wrong. I worked those hours, so I edited the time. I assumed if she had a real issue, we‚Äôd have a conversation in person, not just text.\n\nFast forward 10 days‚ÄîI‚Äôm across the country, enjoying vacation‚Äîand she changes all the company passwords. That freaked me out even before I saw the termination email. And that‚Äôs how I found out: via email. Fired.\n\nPanicking, I called her immediately. Thankfully, she answered. I was barely holding it together and basically begged, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going on? Why did you fire me?‚Äù She says that the way I edited the clock made her lose trust in me. Apparently, she thought I‚Äôd logged out of my account to log into someone else‚Äôs. I explained that I had used both my phone and my company laptop, which had automatically logged me into Montana‚Äôs account (not my own) without me realizing it.\n\nOnce I explained this, she seemed relieved. She even told me, ‚ÄúIt makes sense. I still want you to work for me for years to come!‚Äù I thought it was resolved.\n\nThen‚Äî30 minutes later‚Äîshe calls me again. This time, she says she talked to her husband, co owner, and he still wants me gone. She says there‚Äôs nothing she can do and tells me I‚Äôll ‚Äúdo great in life‚Äù and offers to write me a recommendation. Cool, right?\n\nHere‚Äôs the kicker, I‚Äôve been working for $15 an hour for the past four months, even though I was doing way more than my original front desk job. I took on the role of marketing, social media, and community outreach on top of front desk. No pay increase, no nothing. They promised we‚Äôd discuss my salary after I got back from vacation, so I believed them. But I guess they never planned to have that conversation.\n\nWhat makes it even harder is that I‚Äôve never been punished at this job‚Äîonly praised. It gave me a false sense of appreciation, which is probably why I kept working for such a low rate.\n\nThis whole thing has sent me spiraling into self-doubt and confusion. I was so wrapped up in their lives‚Äînannying their neighbor‚Äôs kids, working at her friend‚Äôs boutique, getting invited over for dinner‚Äîand they fired me over email, while I was on vacation. I just can‚Äôt understand how people can treat someone like that.",

    "selftext": "I (47F) lost my virginity to my dad‚Äôs best friend ‚ÄúAndy‚Äù when I was 20. At the time, he was around 40. Andy was an amazing guy. He could tell a story that kept you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end, or make you snort with laughter for hours.\n\nI was living with my parents and commuting to college. My parents were going through a rough patch, so Andy came over a lot to drink with my dad in the basement and listen to him whine about my mom.\n\nMy original bedroom had been turned into a sewing room for my mom after I finished HS, so I slept in the extra room in the basement. That meant I saw a lot of Andy. My dad frequently passed out in his chair, and Andy would come hang out in my room with me.\n\nThe night it happened was basically the same as any other night we hung out. Something caused the mood to change, and next thing I know, we‚Äôre going at it in my bed. It was incredible. He was so gentle and mindful of my needs. It was perfect for my first time.\n\nWe had sex a lot after that. We would sometimes meet somewhere else, but it was usually in my room after my dad fell asleep. I absolutely fell in love with this man. I knew we could never actually be together, but I couldn‚Äôt stop myself either.\n\nWe stopped having sex after about 2 years. He met someone closer to him in age. She had no desire to have kids, like him. I wanted kids, which was a major reason a real relationship never happened.\n\nAndy died when I was 34. I was devastated, because a part of me never stopped loving him. My dad couldn‚Äôt understand why I could barely function for about a week. I couldn‚Äôt tell him the truth. I knew he‚Äôd be furious and I didn‚Äôt want to ruin his memories of Andy.\n\nI found some pictures of him in the back of my dad‚Äôs closet while we were packing up for him to move. They were from around the same timeframe he took my virginity. Andy‚Äôs been gone so long, but seeing those pictures felt like reopening the wound.\n\nI guess I‚Äôll never really get over his death completely. I‚Äôm married now, with 3 amazing children, and I‚Äôm happy. But they say you never forget your first time, and I‚Äôll never forgot that wonderful man.",

    "selftext": "We have been together for 1 year but have only spent 1 or 2 nights together continuously because we have busy schedules. My bf wants me to move in with him ASAP, and I told him I would in a few months but we went on a trip and I saw a different side to him that I actually hate. \n\n\nMy boyfriend has this hurtful habit of making offensive jokes, specifically about appearance. I feel bad saying this; but my bf is in no position to make comments about appearances. He‚Äôs pretty overweight but i don‚Äôt care and have never mentioned it. He started making jokes about my arms being ‚Äúmassive‚Äù and like ‚ÄúPopEye‚Äù when I was getting ready for dinner. I got upset and started to cry, I felt so insecure. I‚Äôm very fit and muscular, and I‚Äôm always worried I look ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù so it‚Äôs a hurtful spot for me. \n\nWhen I started to cry, he walked out of the hotel and slammed the door behind him and said ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre ready I‚Äôll be downstairs.‚Äù We had a conversation, where he told me he‚Äôs pissed off that I‚Äôm upset, that I can‚Äôt ‚Äútake a joke‚Äù and he‚Äôs ‚Äúsick of having to watch everything he says around me‚Äù in the end he promised me he wouldn‚Äôt comment negatively on my appearance anymore. 2 hrs later we were looking at photos and he says ‚Äúwow, your makeup was actually f**ked up today.‚Äù \n\nI was really bothered by his behaviour on the flight back home. It was only a 5 hour flight but he was ordering SO much food leaving mess everywhere, he left his AirPods in his suitcase in the overhead locker and expected me to get out and make a hassle and get them out for him (he wasn‚Äôt even 100% sure they were in there) when I said I don‚Äôt really feel like waking up the guy next to me to scramble looking for his AirPods, he rolled his eyes and turned his back to me. \n\nHere‚Äôs the real kicker: the flight attendant was giving clear instructions to please buckle seatbelts and turn phones on flight mode but my bf was blatantly ignoring her and trying to upload selfies on Instagram. I asked him if he could please listen to her and he completely flipped and said ‚Äúwhy do you have to piss me off all the time?! You‚Äôre not my mother , I‚Äôll do whatever I please! Don‚Äôt tell me what to do!‚Äù I was so embarrassed that he said that in public so I snapped back and said ‚Äúwell stop acting like a child then‚Äù my bf replies ‚Äúno, YOU are the child!! You don‚Äôt know anything.‚Äù I just closed my eyes and tried to nap. I was holding back tears at this point. After 10 minutes he tried to hold my hand and told me ‚Äúyou know I love you, I‚Äôll always love you. My heart belongs to you.‚Äù \n\nThroughout the trip I just felt like everything was about what he wanted. On one of the days I told him it‚Äôs best if we do our own thing, to which he agreed. We were only apart for 8 hours but he called me a few times asking what I was doing. When we met up again he told me he missed me and was worried about me, he was thinking about me the whole time. For me, it was the complete opposite . Without him I felt peace. \n\nDespite all of this, my bf is always kissing me and cuddling me, telling me he loves me‚Ä¶ when I went home after we got back from the trip he said he‚Äôs so sad to go home without me and he wishes we lived together. But his behaviour on this trip turned me off him completely. How do I tell him I don‚Äôt want to move in? He‚Äôs going to be hurt, I know it. \n\nTldr: my bf and I planned to move in together in a few months but his behaviour on a trip was horrible and I don‚Äôt want to move in anymore. How do I tell him? ",

I've never told anyone about my slimming editing either. A few days ago, I edited a candid picture of mine where I photoshopped my face to look at the camera. I sent my boyfriend the edited image to see if the photoshop was noticeable. but he didn't notice it until I sent him the real image where I wasn't looking in the camera and had my face turned. but the first thing he asked me was, did I edit myself to look slimmer. And even I had forgotten that I edited my body because it was so subtle. it wasn't even noticeable in my eyes. I told him yes I photoshopped it. and then this man proceeds to tell me, \"why did you do that, I love your body shape, how you look, your curves. For a minute I'd gotten worried you've lost too much weight. I love your body in the original picture\". \nAnd I was too speechless to say anything. this man had been telling me he loved my body since the beginning of our relationship but I never believed him... until today. I was truly surprised that he actually loves my body, when even I didn't like it all these years.

    "selftext": "I'm 29. I came from a very conservative country/family with a very religious upbringing and so even though I had a lot of opportunities to explore my sexual side before, I stopped myself from doing it. But I knew I had high libido early on, I think I started \"imagining\" having sex and masturbating when I was in 5th grade. I was humping my own pillow, goddammit. And for a while, I thought it was wrong because I was so young. So I pushed it back. I was in a couple of relationships before I immigrated, but only kissed them. No sexual touching. I controlled myself (and them) in fear of getting pregnant at an early age.\n\nFast forward to today, moved to a new country, met my boyfriend. There's something about being in a new country that makes you want to \"let go\" of who you were, you know? He's very touchy. He's so prim and proper outside, but the first time I came to his apartment, he's a different sexual guy. I resisted for a while but I gave in, and gave up my virginity two weeks into dating. \n\nA year+ later, he's still always touchy. Everytime we watch TV, he needs to have a hand on my boob or thigh. Grabs my boobs everytime he can. He's so cute when he's asleep and unconsciously find my hand to hold or a boob lol. We lie down and cuddle together, the hand has to be holding on to something, either up there or down there. He loves my boobs, he was holding on to it the whole day yesterday. I have more libido than him, unfortunately. We just have sex 2-3x a week. I wish it was more even but he can't sustain it, and I respect that. But his touches always makes me wet. We had sex for 3 straight days the first time ever (there's usually skips) and I'm not sure why, I've been thinking about that fact the whole day, replaying what we did for 3 straight days. Yesterday, we had morning sex, then casually while watching tv, started fingering me and I let him. I was wet the whole evening. A few hours after, we had to shower to sleep, he undressed me and got so horny, he dry humped me from the back while fingering me and holding on to my boob and then dragged me to bed to fuck me. \n\nI just need to get that off my chest because I can't talk about it to anyone, how happy I am or fascinated that I'm finally \"letting go\", and found a guy who can't stop touching me and I love it. He can fuck me whenever he wants, wherever (appropriately).  Some women hate the constant groping, he can do it whenever he wants (privately) and I love it. ",

But for a really brief TL;DR My boyfriend's parents were arrested, his 11 year old brother (\"Avery\") came to live with us, he was doing a lot of behaviours that made me feel uncomfortable and unsettled. \n\nFirst and foremost, thank you all for sending me the love, advice and well-wishes. A lot of you guys pointed out that my boyfriend (\"Caleb\") seemed to be overwhelmed and was just sticking his head in the sand, and honestly yeah. I sat him down a little while after I posted here and we spoke about his brother and everything going on, and he just started crying to me. He has cried in front of me maybe twice before, so I knew he was really feeling it. He said he was really sorry for the way he'd been acting, and that he was just feeling so stressed that he was just pushing everything down and away. \n\nHe agreed that Avery's behaviours were unacceptable, and that I told him he needed to have a firm conversation with Avery about boundaries. Or I just wouldn't be able to live with them much longer. Caleb said he would enforce a change of rules and then he started like sobbing, went grey and started hyperventilating. I was seriously concerned and confused about what was happening. He said he 'needed to tell me something'. I was comforting him, and trying to calm him down and he told me. He was a victim of pretty extreme CSA from his dad, and he thought Avery probably was as well, which we later found out was true.\n\nThat explained a lot, why Avery had no awareness of boundaries, why he was displaying these weirdly sexual behaviours. Why we had such low contact with his parents before all this. But I met his parents, met them multiple times. Yeah we had LC with them, but I met them, I had been to their house. They just seemed like normal people, nice people. They weren't creepy, or scary or weird. I was really shocked at everything Caleb told me. Caleb had been hiding it for so many years, and he felt so ashamed that he hadn't reported it sooner. He said he was really hoping that the abuse hadn't also happened to Avery, and so I think he was trying so hard to ignore any signs that he had. He said he felt responsible because he never reported his dad, which meant the abuse could continue. But I told him none of this was his fault, he has no blame in him being abused or Avery being abused.\n\nWe sought advice on what to do, we reported what Caleb had said to the police and to social services, both Avery and Caleb were interviewed, but we haven't heard much back from the police about anything that might happen next. They said it could be a long process if they manage to bring any charges at all.  Social services started giving us some more support.  \n\nAvery has been behaving a lot better since, he's been listening to boundaries more. He's actually changed a lot in the short time since I posted here last, he's come out a bit more as a pretty charming and charismatic boy. Even though if I'm totally honest he's still a little weird, but maybe that's to be expected after having the life he had. I got him into Scouts and he's made a pack of really close friends, who have even stayed over a few times. He's been getting on well with school although they said he's only on KS1 level work, but I'm sure he'll catch up in time. And even if not, it's not the end of the world.\n\nTL;DR Things have gotten a lot better since my boyfriend opened up about the abuse he had been the victim of. ",

Our school has always collected student cell phones in the morning and returned them at the end of the day. \n\nIt's a very small class. Literally the entire grade is 25 students, 16 of which are girls. I'd been warned ahead of time that there was a lot of \"girl drama\" in that class, so much so that last year, one of the girls ended up in a mental hospital for suicidal thoughts. \n\nI've been hyper-vigilant all year for any signs for drama. There are none. At least, not during the school day. You know, the part of the day when it is my problem. What happens after school and online is not my problem. \n\nAt the conferences, every single parent of one of the girls brought up the drama. I told them all the same thing: What I see during the day is that everyone is getting along just fine. I'm always on the lookout for the drama, but I never see it. \n\nThen they bring up the group chat. I point out that the kids don't have their phones during the day, so there's nothing I can do about it. What I want to say is that you, too, parents, can also take away the phone, if it's the source of the drama. That's a you problem, not a me problem. ",

At the moment I was so confused and everyone was looking at me and my husband sitting beside each other. Everything came to a stop and it was so weird, at first I pretended to take it lightly but later I had a very candid conversation with my husband. Disappointedly, my husband said that it was a fact. I don't know if I am overreacting but I already filed for a divorce and there is no way I am backing off. My husband humiliated me and I feel so bad about it.

    "selftext": "My wife claims she needs to sleep at least 12 hours a day to feel well-rested. This was something that I thought was an exaggeration while we were dating, but after we moved in together I quickly realized was 100% true.\n\nMy wife works a remote job from home, which means that she wakes up at 9am every morning, just barely enough time for breakfast before she clocks in at 9:30. She works 8 hours plus a mandatory 1-hour lunch break (where she speed eats her lunch and goes back to work asap). That means she clocks out at 6:30pm. She makes a point to shower every day, and since she has no time to do it in the morning, she does it after work. That usually means that she's done with everything at around 7:15.\n\nBy this time, I've already arrived home and begun preparing dinner. She usually joins me to give me a hand, and we normally begin eating at around 8. After finishing eating and cleaning up, it's usually about 20 minutes to 9, where my wife will finally decide to partake in one of her hobbies (usually reading), or watch or play something with me. This is the best part of my day. However, this doesn't ever last long enough, since by 9pm my wife will invariably claim she's tired and needs to go to bed.\n\nThis means that I get around 15 to 20 minutes per day of hanging with my wife, which I do not feel is enough.\n\nBut this is only one of the many issues this creates:\n\n- She pressures me to go to bed at the same time she does, claiming it would be weird otherwise for a married couple, and that me not doing so is the reason we don't have much sex. I have tried to disprove her theory by going to bed at 9pm as well and, sure enough, she's always too tired or minutes away from falling fast asleep. We're falling into a dead bedroom and I believe that resentment might be setting in.\n- I get sick if I go to bed that soon after dinner. I have a crappy stomach and my digestion will almost stop if I go to bed after eating a meal. Terrible reflux as well.\n- I just don't want to go to bed at 9, period. 9 is the time of my day where I'm finally free from responsibility and can wind down and do what I want. I don't want to wait for the weekend to be able to do that. I don't want to be miserable for 5 days a week, only to try and squeeze a few hours of fun in-between all the chores that need to be done.\n- About weekends: she keeps her sleep routine. This means that late night outings are out of the question, unless a rare surge of energy happens. There is also not that much time for fun, because the weekend is usually when we tackle the huge backlog of chores that accumulated during the week.\n- About communication: I've tried to communicate to my wife that I *need* to be awake between at least 9-10:30 so I can do stuff I enjoy. I tell her that if she needs sleep, then she at least needs to be okay with the idea that I'll be in the living room doing something else. She has a few strong ideas about this, which leave me frustrated: she believes that there are no such things as night owls and early birds, and that sleep patterns are 100% controllable. She also claims she doesn't need to adjust hers, as she's convinced she sleeps a healthy amount of time and that everyone else should be doing the same as her.\n\n\nI often tell her that she pretty much sleeps and works. That's all she does. She has ADHD and hyper focuses on her work, but her productivity is subpar, meaning she usually takes much longer than normal to complete her tasks (probably due to her struggles with attention). This is a common source of anxiety for her. I also believe she might be burned out, as again, she does nothing else in her awake time but work.\n\nAt this point I'm at a loss on what to do. I just don't want to lose the love of my life and best friend to what I consider an incompatible sleep pattern.",

Truthfully, Older women have always excited me. Maybe it was from all the old lady porn that I watched, but she had a certain allure to her that I couldn't resist. When the time came, I was super excited, and I could tell she was, too. We did the deed and to say it felt great would be an understatement. It felt good after being pent up from lack of good sex over the  past few months. Once the high wore off,  though, I realized how fucked up the whole situation was. To begin with, this woman has kids that are older than me, and grandkids my age. She was also a very sloppy kisser (though she was also hammered, but she also has thin old lady lips so that doesn't help). I think the entire experience has disillusioned the allure of old ladies for me. That could very well be a blessing. Tue shitty thing is that this woman is in town until Thursday, and she's staying at the hotel that work at, and I'm the manager so it's not gonna be easy to avoid her. Anyway, I'm not really looking for advice (though if you have any it's not unwelcome) I just really needed to get this shit out of my system. Thank you for reading",

I have always struggled with my binge eating habits, but when i discovered the ‚Äúbody positive‚Äù and ‚Äúfat acceptance‚Äù community, I felt so seen and heard by these people and had the rhetoric ‚Äúhealth at every size‚Äù hammered into my brain for YEARS. I ignored every health issue that I accumulated and just decided it must be genetics, when it was in fact NOT genetics or anywhere near the realm of healthy or normal.\n\nMy upper arms, calves, feet, and breasts turn purple at any given time. I can barely breathe when I‚Äôm walking up the stairs, I get HORRIBLE golf ball sized friction cysts between my thighs because of how huge they are, and SO many more disgusting and uncomfortable health issues. But the entire time I‚Äôve been experiencing these issues, ever since I was young, I was always told by others in this community that it‚Äôs probably an underlying issue NOT related to my weight or eating habits. I was told that if my doctor says that these health problems are because I‚Äôm obese, then my doctor MUST be ‚Äúfatphobic‚Äù, I have had this shit spewed to me for years and years. \n\nBut a couple weeks ago, after I visited my doctor for my yearly exam and blood work, I was informed over the phone that I am pre-diabetic. I was absolutely floored, I asked how this is possible and my doctor laid it out for me bluntly, and my diet/eating habits, obesity, and lack of physical movement largely attributed to this. This was a huge wake up call to me, and I am fucking PISSED. Not just at the fat acceptance/body positivity community, but at myself, I feel so utterly stupid for not seeing how I‚Äôve been manipulated for years into thinking that my lifestyle is perfectly healthy and sustainable, I was so desperate for companionship and understanding, I believed anything these people told me/posted. I felt so special, being told I was ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù and ‚Äúperfect‚Äù just the way I am, when I am absolutely NOT. I hate myself for being so delusional for all these years, and being a part of a community that fed into these delusions. \n\nI‚Äôm currently on a very strict no sugar and no carb diet, to save my life. I‚Äôm miserable, but I ultimately did this to myself. So this is my warning to everyone who is a part of the fat acceptance/body positive community, WAKE UP BEFORE SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS TO YOU.

I currently can‚Äôt sleep because of all this.\n\n\n\nBack in 2016 I met and fell in love with a guy, I‚Äôll call him Max. Max and I hit it off immediately and our relationship started very quickly. I was 21, almost 22 at the time.\n\n\n\nIn the first week or two of seeing him, I asked how old Max was. He‚Äôs the kind of person who looked like he could be literally any age, it was hard to tell, which is why I asked.\n\nHe avoided the question at first and then asked me ‚ÄúHow old do I look?‚Äù I guessed somewhere around 28-30ish. He smiled and said yes, that was right, I pushed for the exact age and he ‚Äúadmitted‚Äù he was actually 36. He asked me if that was ok with me. My age gap allowance had been 7-10 years, a 15 year age gap was confronting. But I really, really liked him and we got a long really great so I told him it was ok for me, though that would be the maximum age gap I‚Äôm comfortable with.\n\n\n\nWe went on to be in a long term loving relationship for 7ish years.¬†\n\n\n\nCurrently (2024) we are now going through a very long, drawn-out heart-breaking break up. It‚Äôs complicated, I don‚Äôt have time to get into all the details here! He thinks I don‚Äôt express my emotions well and I think he‚Äôs manipulative and simply doesn‚Äôt like it when I ever have a negative emotion. We have to remain living together for now (separate bedrooms and bathrooms). \n\nAbout a week ago, he left to go on a much needed trip, and I‚Äôve been loving having the house to myself.¬†\n\n\n\nBut today I stumbled upon the truth‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nI‚Äôm not going to get into how I came upon it, but it was by accident. I came upon his birth date written on an official document. He had always been super secretive of official documents and made sure I never really saw them.¬†\n\n\n\nYa‚Äôll‚Ä¶ the way my jaw hit the floor when I read his birth year: 1970!!!\n\n\n\nHe is literally 24 years older than me. \n\n\n\nHe is older than my freaking mother.\n\n\n\nI literally am flabbergasted. I feel so.. omg, I don‚Äôt even know, I feel disgusting honestly.\n\n\n\nI feel violated. This man lied to me just to get me and then continued to lie‚Ä¶ like was he just never going to tell me?\n\nHe wasn't 36 when he met me, he was 46! And I was 22 barely out of home!\n\nI'm questioning reality right now, like what other secrets have I missed??? Did he have a family? Is he a criminal? Like what the heck???\n\nI feel totally blindsided and disillusioned. Like I‚Äôm living in the Truman Show or something crazy. I feel like this can't possibly be real... but it is.\n\nI'll start looking at housing alternatives (I really just want to kick him out!)\n\n\n\nI‚Äôve emailed my therapist already, so don‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôm going to wait until he‚Äôs back home to confront him about it.\n\nHow would you confront him? Has anyone else been in this situation before, what did you do? And what happened when you confronted them?\n\n  \nI'll update in a few weeks... ",

The kids were hit especially hard by my husband‚Äôs passing, especially our son who was very close with him.

I understand this comes from a place of care and worry, but they continue pushing even when I say I am not interested.\n\nMy husband was truly my other half, I simply can‚Äôt imagine moving on and replacing him. He will live forever in my heart and I sincerely hope to see him again when I pass on. It is one of the only dreams I have left for the future. When our children tell me it‚Äôs okay to move on, I can‚Äôt help but feel I would be disrespecting his memory and the thought of being with anyone else fills me with disgust.\n\nI truly have no desire to move on. I think I‚Äôll spend the remainder of my life waiting to be reunited with my love. How do I convince our children I have no wishes to move on without being disrespectful to their concerns?",

They said she has endocarditis and the infection may be in her spine and brain as well. Even if they cure the infection, they're not sure what her mental status is going to look like. They decrease the sedation meds a couple times a day to see if she's improved mentally/if she's less confused but so far she hasn't shown much improvement. \n\nShe has been using drugs intravenously for many years. I've watched her deteriorate for more than a decade, but I think she is actually dying this time.\n\nI watched my dad cry at her hospital bedside today and it was soul crushing.

    "selftext": "A couple of years ago, my wife and I lost our daughter due to a tragic accident. It really took a toll on both of us. We have gone through extensive therapy (joint and separate) and were doing better, however I‚Äôm afraid the recent birth of our baby girl has caused her mental state to relapse. It‚Äôs affecting our marriage. She thinks our baby is our late daughter reincarnated. We waited a long time to try again for a second child. Heck, we even moved houses and states so we wouldn‚Äôt have to see her room or where the accident occurred anymore. As soon as we found out we were having another girl, my wife asked if we could make her middle name the name of our firstborn to honor her. I thought it was a sweet tribute so I agreed. When she had the baby, the first thing she said to anyone who came to visit was how much the baby looks like our first daughter. They really don‚Äôt look alike, but I digress. One night, I went to go get us dinner while the baby was asleep. I was only gone for a few minutes. When I came back, I found my wife outside in the garden holding the baby singing ‚ÄúYou are my Sunshine‚Äù but replacing the word sunshine with her middle name, our deceased daughter‚Äôs name. She buys items for the baby with that name on it. She has a shrine type thing of pictures of both girls next to each other and insists on remaking certain photos. I have expressed my concerns to her but she brushes me off, saying that it‚Äôs her way of coping, and refuses to go back to therapy. I‚Äôm thinking long term, this would cause so much trauma for our daughter if it keeps going on like this once she‚Äôs old enough to understand. I feel for my wife though. She became a bereaved mother at a young age and obviously still has issues that need to be worked out. She‚Äôs not a dangerous person, and I hate to even think this way, but I‚Äôm not sure what she may do in this state. And I don‚Äôt know how to go about it. ",

The other claim comes from a teacher who was harassed by the parent because they taught the class about modern-day slavery.\n\nPersonally, I hope they take the parent for all their worth. It's ridiculous that a teacher can't talk about the ills that are in the world today that need to be addressed with their students. And let's be honest, most the books that they pull from libraries and school libraries are not at all pornographic or inappropriate. Hell, the Bible has more sex, incest, and murder in it than most those books that parents claim are inappropriate.\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/second-hilton-head-teacher-sues-152824143.html",

It‚Äôs almost like meditation, something I‚Äôve never been able to do. Because they need to eat a variety of organic vegetables, I‚Äôm also forced to eat healthier myself. They‚Äôre still fairly small, so they can‚Äôt eat a whole vegetable by themselves yet, so I have to cook the rest, haha. I went through a really tough period in my life, but they‚Äôve helped me through it. It might seem silly, but they‚Äôve truly changed my life for the better.",
