But any new shows forget it. I just tried watching one I have seen advertised on tiktok and made it through about 10 minutes and knew exactly where it was going and shut it off. Wish I could say it is just movies but it's books too.. last book I read I got about 3/4 through went \"my favorite character is gonna die isn't he.\" and jumped to the end and yep.. he died.. instantly lost all interest in the book. \n\nAm I just the odd ball one for this or is this more common then I think? and how if there are more like me do you cope? \n\n(I am unmedicated and plan to stay that way.. to old to be doing this song and dance again) ",
