  "selftext": "I used to tell myself over and over in the last 2 years that I was going to get up off of my ass someday and do something with my life. Every time, I’d say I’d train for a marathon, get off social media, read a book for once. And I failed every time. At the end of the day, nothing would change. I’d keep on scrolling, laying in my bed like a vegetable.\n\nBut I never made that mistake again after I read David Goggin's \"Can't Hurt Me\". My mindset changed for good. I learned that there is no secret sauce when it comes to being disciplined. Change sucks for everyone. The people who become great just deal with the pain.\n\nWorking out became a non-negotiable privilege: I Venmo-ed my friend $300 and told him to give it back only if I ran a mile a day for a month. I never took my health for granted again, and guess what—I got that money back, and my health back.\n\nSocial media to 2 hours a day: I used to doomscroll for 8+ hours a day out of boredom. It was only when I realized that I have to love the pain that comes with boredom that I made a change. I cleaned up my home screen, put my ebooks (got a bunch of books on Apple Books) front and center. I made it hard as hell to get into my socials (set up an app literally forces me talk with an ai to unlock Instagram). Now I actually treat the time I have on this earth seriously. My mental health is better, and my compulsive scrolling is gone.\n\nAnd guess what? It all compounds. One book got the ball rolling. And once the ball's rolling, it gains momentum.\n\nTake this as your sign to embrace the pain that comes with change. You'll never regret it.",
