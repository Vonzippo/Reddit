Turned off work notifications on my phone - work life balance, baby!\n\nMy work does a company-wide shutdown at xmas every year. A few years in a row thus far. I had thought the shutdown was the week of Christmas. I apparently just remembered wrong.\n\nLogged in this morning to realize nobody else had logged in. Dug through emails and realized that I had screwed up and the shutdown is \"between Christmas and New Years\" (they are actually shut down from Dec 26th to Jan 3rd). \n\nSo yeah, I just didn't show up to work on Monday and Tuesday last week (23rd and 24th). I got a message from my manager on the 24th - who was confused and thought I'd be back for the 2 days before Christmas. Nobody called me or messaged my personal phone. \n\nI am MORTIFIED. I want to crawl into a hole...\n\nWHY DO I DO THESE THINGS?!\n\nI don't think I'm fired or anything but this is not the professional demeanor I try so hard to portray. ðŸ˜ž",
