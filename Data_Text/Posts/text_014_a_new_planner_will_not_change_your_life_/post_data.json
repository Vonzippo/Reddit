  "selftext": "It's that time of the year...your tiktok fyp is full of people setting up their bullet journals for the new year, your Instagram is full of ads to buy a hobonichi...but wait! It's a trap!!! \n\nTake the $50 Moleskine leather bound weekly 2025 planner out of your cart. \n\nDo NOT, under any circumstances, go into any bookstores, office supply stores, or stationary stores for the next 3-5 days. \n\nIgnore any and all links you see for the ADHD life-changing organizer, designed for people with ADHD by people with ADHD. \n\nRemember that you can try a new system whenever you want, reinvention doesn't have to start on January 1st. They are preying on our lust for new notebooks and the dopamine we get from setting up new systems!!! Don't let them win! ",
