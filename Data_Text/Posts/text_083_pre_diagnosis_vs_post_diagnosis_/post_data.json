  "selftext": "Partially inspired by folks discussing symptoms they didnâ€™t attribute to ADHD until after their diagnosis. \n\nI never used to smile in photos. I was severely depressed and had lots of anxiety. I couldnâ€™t understand why I was having so much trouble socially and didnâ€™t really feel like I fit in anywhere. Friends kept dropping me and I kept getting into abusive relationships. I also had an eating disorder and terrible body dysmorphia. I did well academically and was doing well in my field, so I didnâ€™t suspect ADHD until I hit severe burn out during the pandemic. I realized how much I was masking. After that it took me two years to get diagnosed. \n\nIâ€™m not medicated, but I have a therapist who specializes in ADHD. I got into weight lifting and martial arts, and moved to a city thatâ€™s not as over-stimulating. My communication skills are improving and I feel like Iâ€™m finally able to maintain healthy relationships. Itâ€™s easier to stay organized without getting burnt out, and I hardly ever feel depressed anymore. My anxiety only comes up as a pms symptom now. I still have issues with body dysmorphia from time to time, but I can focus more on being SWOL rather than being pencil-thin. I still got some problems, but itâ€™s a night and day difference compared to how I was before. Plus, I actually smile in photos now ðŸ˜Š\n\nGetting diagnosed was the best decision of my life. ",
