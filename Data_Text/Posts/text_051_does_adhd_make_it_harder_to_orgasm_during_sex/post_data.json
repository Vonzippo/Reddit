  "selftext": "Okay honest to god, I feel like ADHD makes it harder for me (f22) to cum during sex. Like I feel like I’ll be getting close, and then my mind wanders or I get distracted and I can’t finish. Sometimes I can’t even get close because I get distracted too easily. My bf gets frustrated sometimes because he always wants me to finish and enjoy myself but sometimes i literally just can’t because I CANNOT FOCUS. And then I just kinda fizzle out and get bored because I’m thinking about cows or my psych assignment or some random shit. Does anyone else have this problem??",
