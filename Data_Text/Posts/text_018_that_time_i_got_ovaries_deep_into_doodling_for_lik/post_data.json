Let‚Äôs not discuss the amount of money I spent on Micron pens or the fact that I still haul a whole bag of them around with me along with a sketchbook that has FOUR whole pages doodled in it!\n\nLast pic is a bonus photo of the first page of said sketchbook, and is the sole result the last time the ‚ú®creative spirit‚ú® overtook me (well, that and the purchase of a $200 set of Tombow markers). ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThe good news is I can technically use all this shit at my job - the bad news is I can‚Äôt get them reimbursed bc I took them home and played with them first lol.\n\n(Note that most of those doodles are *not* my invention - they‚Äôre mostly copied or closely inspired from various YouTube doodling videos.)",
