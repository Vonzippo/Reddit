  "selftext": "I’ve been with my partner for over a year. I’m in my early 20s, so are they. Before we even started dating we talked about our views on children. I want to have a kid one day, I really do, but I think it would be extremely selfish to have one now. I would have to give up my clients (my job is very physically active), my final year of school would be interrupted, and my mental health is not in a great place at all. I would have to stop the medication I rely on for mental health. \nMy partner’s family is very against abortion. His mom almost died when having him, and they told her that if she didn’t snort the baby she would die. She didn’t- she was lucky. \nMy partner isn’t against other people getting abortiond, but when it comes to his kid, he is. \nRight before I found out we had broken up a few times. I didn’t want this, but he knew my mental health was in a horrible place and felt like he was making it worse. I don’t know about that, but regardless. I told him I was pregnant and he was immediately by my side. But he wants me to keep it and I can’t. I can’t bring a child into this world with no money and bad mental health. \nHe told me he doesn’t know if he can even see me. He said after this, he will never speak to me again. His mom told him if he speaks to me again she will disown him. \nNot only am I loosing a child, but I’m losing him, and I’m totally alone. My mental health was already in a bad place and now it’s worse than it ever has been. \n",
