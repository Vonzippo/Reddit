  "selftext": "hello everybody! just a 1 month update on my porn addiction recovery and i gotta say i’m doing quite well for myself (so far) although the first 2 weeks were a real struggle, Ive been going to the gym 3-4 times a week lately and i can definitely feel and see a difference in my mind and body. i’m no longer overwhelmed with that “lust” feeling i always get and I was also able to find a new job, now i’m working at a lumber yard. \n\ni’m still struggling with socializing and conversing with people especially with woman but i know i just gotta keep putting myself out there. all in all, everything’s been going great, i’m making progress at least. \n\nthanks to everyone for encouraging me and showing support on my last post! really means a lot. now i just gotta play my part and keep her going ",
