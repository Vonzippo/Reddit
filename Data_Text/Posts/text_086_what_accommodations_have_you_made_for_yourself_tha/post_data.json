  "selftext": "One of the best accommodations I’ve made for myself recently was changing the light bulb in my bathroom to a smart light.\n\nThe regular light was harsh and overstimulating, especially during showers. I loved the idea of showering in the dark, but turning off the light also turned off the vent— and that felt like a recipe for mold. I was considering waterproof candles and shelves - but got overwhelmed with the cost and options, and unsure about the batteries and charging. The smart bulb solved everything. Now, I can dim the light to a more soothing level and even switch the color to something calming, like a soft blue or warm orange. It was a pretty simple adjustment, but it’s made showers (and self-care in general) feel so much more manageable and enjoyable - and I finally cleaned the light fixture/vent I’ve been staring at and meaning to for longer than I’d like to admit (years?).\n\nIt’s a small thing, but the impact on my sensory environment has been huge. I’ve been so surprised at how much less reluctant I am to shower and just how much more pleasant the experience of transitioning to the shower has gotten as well as the in-shower experience. What accommodations have you made for yourself that turned out to be total game-changers.",
