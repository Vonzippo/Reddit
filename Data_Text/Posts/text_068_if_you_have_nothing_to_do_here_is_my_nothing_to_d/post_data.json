Lets reverse it!\n\nDental hygiene:\n1) Floss\n2) Tongue scrape\n3) Brush\n\nYour devices upkeep:\n1) Clean your laptop/PC display and keyboard\n2) Charge everything\n3) Delete all the unnessesary files (a lot can be unveiled from here actually) \n\nOverall hygiene and home organisation:\n1) Change the blankets\n2) Go wash your clothes, towels\n3) Wash the dishes \n4) Pick up the dust\n5) Go to the shower \n6) Peel the vegetables ahead \n7) Cut nails\n8) Ask everything you see does it need to be cleaned \n\nTrack:\n1) Sleep. Right down how much did you sleep, when you went to bed and when woke up, what was your last meal etc\n2) Foods you ate (use Chronometer) \n3) Exercise\n4) Money you spend\n) Anything else you believe worth Tracking \n\nDont overwhelm yourself with creating systems of notes though. I use both paper and apps, spontaneously. \n\nAnd if you have completely nothing to do, here is some skills I believe universally benefitial to learn:\n\n1) Cut you own hair (save a bunch of money and achieve better look) \n2) Start exercise (very basic, but you'll definitely fill fulfillment. Start from the smallest effort possible and build up from it) \n3) Language (also basic, but easily to get addict–µd) \n\nRemember, it won't be the funniest thing ever, but you'll quickly learn that fun = do, what you're supposed to do!
