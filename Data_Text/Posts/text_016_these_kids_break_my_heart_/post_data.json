  "selftext": "Today I was writing the IEP for a high school aged boy. This is the first year he’s been on my caseload, so I was going over the basics, making sure things like address and phone numbers were up to date. He saw his dad’s name and kind of smirked. He told me that his dad lives in another state, isn’t part of his life, and he had no idea why he’d be listed as part of the IEP team. I responded that even if he didn’t see him often, that his dad probably still wanted to stay informed. The student, with a self-protecting smile, then said “4 years ago he told me he never even wanted me to be born. He doesn’t care about this stuff.” You know, I get that parents don’t work out sometimes, but how could any adult say something so cruel to a child? The boy brushed it off like he was fine and it didn’t matter, but I told him I was angry on his behalf and was so sorry that happened. It also explains a LOT about this kid’s behavior and general attitude. I just want to find that dad and give him a piece of my mind. I won’t of course, but a girl can dream. ",
