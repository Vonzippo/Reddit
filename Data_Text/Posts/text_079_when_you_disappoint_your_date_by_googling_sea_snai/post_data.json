  "selftext": "Everything was going so well. I looked good. Fancy restaurant. Somehow got on the topic of sharks (I brought it up) then mentioned an infographic I saw where sea snails were actually the 3rd deadliest creature etc etc. (blah blah)\n\nTried to find infographic. Found pictures of snails instead. Talked at him about several images of snails and concluded that “the snails needed this win”.\n\nI know for the right person it won’t be a buzz kill. \nBut I also understand how it was.\n\nPlease send best wishes on my journey.",
