After noticing I couldn't really sit straight, tapped my feet a lot, she said she had to protect herself from my energy because it could affect her.\n\nI wasn't being rude to her, didn't talk over her, I was extremely focused on her questions, but I couldn't help my body. I'm usually hyper and fidgety, but I get EXTRA at the doctors' office. I'm always terrified of them. \n\nAnd it got worse: after learning I take Atomoxetine, she basically ranted on how everybody is ADHD/Autistic now.\n\nI just feel at a loss here. I have this chronic feeling that I never come across good doctors. I've been having a hard time with hormonal issues (I'm in my late 30s), and I'm scared I won't find anyone who could help me with less judgement. ",
