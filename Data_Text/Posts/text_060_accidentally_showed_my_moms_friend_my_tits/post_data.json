That being said, I don't go bare in front of people who have not explicitly stated that they are comfortable with that. (The only people on that list are my parents and two friends)  \nMy mom had a friend over for dinner, so I put my dressing gown on whenever I left my room. I walked out and put my orange peel in the bin, helped flip the salmon paddies and was back in my doorway when I realised I didn't have my dressing gown on.  \nI apologized to the friend immediately. My mom was in the room too, and didn't even notice until I apologized, but said that out of anyone, this friend was probably the best person for this to happen with. The friend said that usually she would feel uncomfortable about what happened, but that it somehow just felt casual, and that's why she didn't say anything.",
