  "selftext": "i 22(f) was out to the club for the first time on my 21st birthday with my sister and a few friends, last i remember i was on my second drink and dancing with a girl i met that night. next thing i know, im waking up at my sisters and it’s 3pm the next day. i was so confused and was also in a different shirt than what i went out in. after going to the bathroom i realize my underwear is on backwards under my pants and i have light bruises on my legs and the back of my arms. i wake everyone up and they’re all pissed thinking i just disappeared last night. apparently they were searching for me for hours and filed a missing persons report. the police found me at 9am, miles away in an abandoned house with two guys, they said they took good care of me, and i told the cops i was good and there by choice. i don’t remember a second of any of this and immediately was terrified. i went to the hospital and got the kit done, drug testing, and preventative medication, and my friend had to give another police report. they told me processing takes awhile and ill hear back. the police station told me the same thing. eventually the hospital sent me to the SVU and i had to give a statement. i’ve made several phone calls and there’s been no update or information and it’s been over a year now. open to comments and questions. \n\ngetting this off my chest ",
