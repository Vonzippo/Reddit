It rolled over him, crushing his chest and dragging him 30 feet.  He's going to be taken off of life support today.  \n\nI don't want to be a downer, but I though that it needed to be talked about.  All you lovely wonderful people PLEASE be careful, especially with cars.  We are twice as likely to die from accidents in general, and apparently it's our leading cause of death.  It's not worth the rush.",

  "varied_selftext": "---------------------------\nApologies if this feels heavy. It's such an unreal tragedy. He was out handling some tasks, and he jumped out of his vehicle after accidentally forgetting to set it in park. The car rolled over him, crushing his chest and dragging him about 30 feet. He's scheduled to be disconnected from life support today.\n\nI don't mean to be depressing, but I felt this needed to be shared. All you incredible, amazing people PLEASE stay vigilant, especially around vehicles. We're statistically twice as prone to fatal accidents overall, and apparently it's our primary cause of mortality. It's simply not worth the hurry."
