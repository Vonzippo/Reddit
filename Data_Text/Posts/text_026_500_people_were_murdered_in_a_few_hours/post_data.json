You can’t imagine the videos and voice mails that came outta there people begging to be killed just not be tortured or raped (male, female or child) women committing suicide because they know if the RSF captured them, they will mercilessly gang rape them and eventually kill them anyway. Men were gathered in a farm and were chased down by technical vehicles mounted with machine guns and were asked to run and whoever stops get shot with the machine gun.This is not  a movie a video game or a novel this is real life, people in my country are begging for a mercy bullet. The sadder part is that the UAE knows everyone is busy with Gaza nowadays, so no one will even take a look at what are they doing to a poor third world country. All I could say is a quote from a guy that was shot dead yesterday before he sent this voice note “ we are not waiting for anything from anyone we just want gods mercy” ",
