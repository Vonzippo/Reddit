I was focused intently on the conversation and what she was saying when suddenly she goes “Hey! Are you even listening?” \n\nI look at her and I’m like: “Yeah of course I am! Please continue what you were saying”\n\nShe then says “it’s fine. I get it. You’re not interested. You’re not even looking at me, you’ve looked at everything in the room except me.”\n\n\nIt was at this point he knew he fucked up.\n\nBut then I realised this isn’t the first time and it’s always been the same.\n\nWhen I’m listening to someone talk and I’m trying really hard to focus on them, I look away from them. I never realised this about myself and I totally understand it makes me look like a dickhead. At least now I know!\n\nThis needlessly long post was brought to you by the character limit, thanks character limit!",
