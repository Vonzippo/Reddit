  "selftext": "A new study was published yesterday in the [British Journal of Psychology](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjc.12485). They've finally done a study on something I think a lot of us have suspected for a while. You're more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD later if you have high IQ. This doesn't surprise me at all to be honest.\n\nI suspect the hierarchy for diagnosis, especially as a child is:\n\n- Hyperactive/ disruptive regardless of intelligence \n- Inattentive with a parent who has it and knows the signs regardless of intelligence \n- Inattentive with average intelligence or less (may or may not be diagnosed as a child)\n- Inattentive with high intelligence (unlikely to be diagnosed as a kid and perhaps at all)\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
