  "selftext": "Y'all. After years of avoiding the dentist because I'm so so ashamed of how bad my teeth have gotten bc hygiene is HARD, I finally went to the worst dentist ever. And then the nicest dentist ever.\n\n\nThis man looked me in the eyes and said, \"I can tell you're doing your best. It's not my job to judge that, it's my job to help make your best better.\"\n\n\nHis hygienist complimented my fidget toys that I use to have alternative sensory input during dental stuff. \n\n\nHe checked in throughout the process, and gave me breaks. He told me whenever he was going to switch tools.\n\n\nWhen I reacted to the nasty grinding noise of That One Particular Tool, he paused, and told me, \"I can accomplish what you need with a different tool, but it will take a few minutes longer. Is that okay?\"\n\n\nMy teeth look sooooo much nicer after! And and and! I'm actually not freaking out about the next 2 appointments to finish fixing all my teeth!",
