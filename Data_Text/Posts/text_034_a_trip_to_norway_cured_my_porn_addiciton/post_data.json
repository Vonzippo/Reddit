  "selftext": "I’m a 23M, and I’ve been struggling with porn addiction since I was 11. It only got worse over the years. Whenever I felt anxious, sad, or unsure about something, I turned to porn as a way to escape. For a few minutes, it helped me forget my problems, but the relief never lasted. Eventually, I was watching it several times a day, and it completely took over my life.  \n  \nPorn destroyed my confidence and self-esteem. I started seeing myself as dirty and disgusting, which in a way, I was. It rotted my brain and spread into every area of my life without me realizing it. It controlled me, and I couldn’t stop. It even changed how I saw women, making me view them as objects of pleasure instead of real people. I lost my motivation to work out, to stay disciplined, and to improve myself. It was such a slow and gradual addiction that I didn’t even notice how bad it had gotten.    \n  \nUntil I decided to book my first solo trip to Norway. I hadn’t planned on beating my addiction during the trip. I figured I’d deal with it afterwards. I didn’t expect anything huge to come from the trip... I just wanted to get out of my comfort zone and experience something new. But what I didn’t know was that this trip would change my life in ways I couldn’t imagine.    \n  \nIn Norway, I discovered a part of myself I didn’t know existed. Being in a place where no one knew me gave me the chance to start fresh. I could become the person I wanted to be. I started socializing more than ever, went on hikes, met amazing people, and even went on a romantic date with a girl I connected with deeply.  \n  \nSomething shifted inside me, and it was a permanent change. I saw the kind of life I could have and the kind of person I could be, and I just knew I had beaten my addiction. It’s hard to explain, but it felt like something inside me flipped. I had tried many times before to quit, and I always ended up relapsing. But this time felt different. I knew I had turned a corner and I wasn’t going back.   \n  \nIt's been a long while, so much so I've lost track of how many days I've gone without porn. Since I returned home, I haven’t thought about watching it once. And if temptation ever comes again, I know I won’t give in. Once I got a taste of life without it, I knew I couldn’t go back to the old me.    \n  \nI was using porn to cope with feelings like loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and uncertainty. But when I finally made an effort to change my surroundings and cope with those feelings in better ways, the addiction lost much of its power. Doing things that keep you busy and connected to others helps. Try signing up for events, joining sports groups, going to the gym, working at a café, or taking more walks. Commit to it. Filling your time with activities that lie outside your damn comfort zone can slowly fade the urge to rely on bad habits.  \n    \nI’m writing this in hopes it inspires at least someone out there. You can break free from it, and it’s worth it. Once you quit, everything gets better: your energy, your sleep, your eating habits, your posture, your confidence. You feel like working out again, the brain fog clears up, you become more motivated to do things and your focus improves.    \n    \nThat trip to Norway, my first solo trip, was like a rite of passage for me. It was the moment I left my old self behind and stepped into a new chapter of my life. Writing this is also a reminder to myself, so if I ever feel tempted, I can look back at this and remember how sad it would be to go back after everything I’ve overcome.    \n    \nIf you’re reading this and struggling with the same thing, I want you to know I believe in you. You can overcome it. You’re stronger than you think. It's worth it. It really is. Please trust me.",
