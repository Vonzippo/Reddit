  "selftext": "was so easy as a kid apparently. i was messy, hyper-talkative, made my own songs and sung them for hours on end, but i could sit for hours fixating on things. so i was ‘easy.’ \n\nthis is why no one believed i had adhd. because i wasn’t a boy either, no body knew or believed me as a young teen. when i had younger brothers, and they were miss behaved my parents got them tested for adhd because it’s in our family.\n\nthey didn’t have it. got myself tested when i moved out, shockingly i had it. \n\ni wish someone would have believed me. even though i was ‘easy’ for everyone else, doesn’t mean i wasn’t struggling.
