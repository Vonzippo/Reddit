  "selftext": "I've a man, almost 30 years old and been unemployed and single for almost a decade now. I got addicted to porn and over the years my taste has gotten more and more degenerate. It got to a point where I started getting off to skimpily dressed teenage girls on tiktok. I didn't actually look up illegal forms of p0rn or appraoch any of them IRL but young girls seemed so tempting to me. Lately I've tried improving my life by getting a (not very well paying) job, getting in touch with old friends and starting to eat better and get in shape.\n\nAll that has been great but the thing that makes me the happiest is I recently started noticing that I no longer have interest in teenage girls and they look more like children to me and I just don't care. Instead I'm finding women my age more attractive and when I realized that I felt so happy I could cry becuase I felt like a horrible person this whole time.",
