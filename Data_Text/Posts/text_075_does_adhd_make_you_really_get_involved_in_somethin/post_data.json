  "selftext": "This has been going on with for so long decades that I would be entranced with something and then all of a sudden I wasn’t. \n\nFor example. Right now I have bought 3 different pairs of headphones and I am absolutely into it , I spent all weekend researching headphones like I was going crazy but I couldn’t stop myself.
