  "selftext": "Big thanks to Concerta XL for enabling me to start earlier than I thought I would need to (although still not early enough haha), and enabling me to clear my diary to save enough time to sit and get it done. I'm super proud of myself! I don't think I could have done this without recognising that my brain will work against me, and taking steps to mitigate this. \n\nIt was my first time working with tulle, making a corset, resizing a pattern, and just making a dress all by myself actually. I'm so glad I am able to recognise where my issues are coming from, and take appropriate steps to help myself! This would have been an impossible task before diagnosis ðŸ¥¹\n\nAnd thanks to ADHD for my unbridled creativity and 'overly-ambitious' ideas. I just needed a little help to channel that into making my ideas a reality. ",
