  "selftext": "This is what we ended up doing to our fireplace. Itâ€™s milk paint, so water-based allowing the brick to breathe and preventing crumbling issues down the line. We came to the conclusion that it was added in the 60s/70s as the original chimney runs closer to the center of the house. I'm sure not many of you will like it, but I still wanted to see it through.",
