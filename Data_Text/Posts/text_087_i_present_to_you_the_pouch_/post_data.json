  "selftext": "I have found my ADHD hack. I just have a pouch with all the things I need during the day. I bring it everywhere, I have it with me at all times, it’s always somewhere near me (at home, at work, at the gym, etc). Since I’ve had it, I felt better going on with my daily life as it has all the little things I can need during the day to feel more comfortable. I also loose way less stuff because I like to switch bags depending on my outfit. It’s full of little objects I like that give me dopamine everytime I see them. I just love my pouch. ",
