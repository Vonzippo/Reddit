  "selftext": "Basically what the title says. My screen time was terrifying.. on my rot days it was over 12 hours (I haven't shared this ever but I know this is a safe space ha) and never that much less on normal days.. \n\nI know this isn't a rare experience for our community, but my phone addiction was starting to ruin my life. The constant thirst for dopamine made me depressed for much of last year.\n\nI just want to share with anyone who's feeling the same - the idea of actually removing my iPhone from my life was embarrassingly nauseating and its taken me months to do it, as if there was some huge risk attached.. but I did it, and it was so simple. A foggy cloud has lifted in a way I've not yet experienced, not even with my medication. \n\nSure, my adhd brain is still the same, but it feels like I've just declogged a blocked drain and now the water can flow. I can prioritise my life and I'm able to live with intention. \n\nAs someone who is trying to find methods to build the structure I need beyond my meds and without a coach, this has been life changing. And to anyone who can relate to the feelings I had, I promise it isn't as bad as you think if you're committed to the change. And to those who can't relate, don't worry about it, you're good haha\n\nits only been a week, but I gave my old iPhone away and not a single strand of me sees it coming back into my life.
