  "selftext": "26F who got officially diagnosed at 25. \n\nEVERY DAY I find out more and more things that I didn't know were ADHD/not normal for neurotypicals.\n\nOne of them: Hyping myself up to do almost ANYTHING. Watch extreme house cleaning videos in order to clean the house. In college, I remember watching vlogs of other college students going to study and \"be productive\" right before I had to spend the day studying and being productive.\n\n  \nI didn't know that people could actually just \\~do the thing that needed to be done\\~ without this extra help. :') \n\n  \nI've been putting off cleaning my shower so I deep dove into shower cleaning videos, and you wouldn't believe how sparkling my shower is right now! \n\n",
