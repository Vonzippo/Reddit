  "selftext": "So, like a lot of people with ADHD I have auditory processing disorder. If you don't know what that is it just means that I have a hard time understanding other people talking. I can hear just fine, but the part of brain that processes speech doesn't work right. It's like I have lag. Anyway, I work as a laundry worker at a hotel and I have a lot of coworkers who don't speak English, or only speak a little. And I feel so bad constantly having to ask them to repeat themselves, because their probably already self conscious about the language barrier, but my brain just can not handle any accented speech. I can barely understand native English speakers. Sorry, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I really do feel, bad but there's not really anything I can do. I wish there were subtitles for real life.",
