  "selftext": "The straw broke the camels back last night and I guiltily feel almost relieved about it. For context;\n\nMy husband (33M) either cannot or will not prioritize me (29F) at all. We have been married for almost 8 years. Iâ€™m not expecting to be treated like a queen, but I want to be treated like Iâ€™m actually his partner in life. \n\nMy husband is a blue collar worker who works a family business in the construction field. Because itâ€™s a family business there is seemingly no boundary between his work and personal life. Itâ€™s like heâ€™s married to his job. Anniversary trips have been canceled the day before because he needed to work, he couldnâ€™t pick me up from surgery because he needed to work last minute, he has canceled every date Iâ€™ve tried to plan in the last 4 years because he suddenly has to work (I gave up a year ago though), etc. It just seems like every time I try to plan something to spend time with him, he suddenly needs to work and cancels on me last minute. I constantly feel like Iâ€™m being stood up for prom, but Iâ€™m his wife? \n\nBut itâ€™s not as if he only prioritizes work and flakes on his friends. There are much too many examples of how he has been able to make plans with his buddies to meet up and drink beer, smoke cigars, shoot the shit. His friends will call him and invite him on spur-of-the-moment week-long fishing trips, and my husband will leave work immediately to pack and hit the road. But when I wanted to go to a nice restaurant for our anniversaryâ€”one eveningâ€”he told me the night before that I needed to cancel the reservation because he would be working late. It makes me feel like he prioritizes spending time with his friends over me because heâ€™ll easily blow off work for them, but he never does for me.\n\nI also feel like he prioritizes his goals over mine. He has taken out loans for the family businessâ€™ sake using our joint money without even talking to me about it first. This has happened 3 times. All through our dating relationship and engagement he told me he wanted children. After we had been married 4 years ago, I told him I wanted to start trying for a baby. He told me he never wanted kids and he had always been afraid to tell me because he didnâ€™t want to lose me. But now I feel like he took away my option.\n\nI really do appreciate how hard my husband works. But I just wanted to spend time with him and have time made for me, like heâ€™ll do for his friends. I have made peace with the fact that I may never be a mother, I am not sure if Iâ€™m being petty about this entire thing but I feel like he robbed me of my best chance and years for doing it, at the very least. \n\nI told him in April that I wanted to get a divorce and I explained why, but I told him I was willing to do marriage counseling. He told me he wanted to do marriage counseling with our pastor. So we did and my husbandâ€™s biggest issue with me is that Iâ€™m disorganized. Itâ€™s true, I have ADHD and often lose things. Iâ€™m trying to work on it. My husband also complained about our sex life, but I tried explaining that Iâ€™m rarely in the mood because he ONLY ever touches me when he wants to have sex. Never wants to hold hands, hug me, kiss me, etc. So now I cringe when he reaches for me because I know it only because he wants to have sex. And I think because I was the one asking for the divorce, I was seen as the problem/trouble maker. The pastor was convinced that I had some romantic comedy script in my mind and I wasnâ€™t being realistic about what it means to run your own business. I had to work on being more understanding, patient, and on lowering my expectations and standards. I feel like all I had been asking for was to be treated like a priority and not an afterthought.\n\nBut the straw broke the camelâ€™s back last night. We have been planning to go on a long weekend trip with my siblings and their spouses this upcoming weekend. Two days ago my husband told me he had to work this upcoming weekend and couldnâ€™t go on the trip. Nevermind that itâ€™s non-refundable at this point. I said okay and would see if I could get a friend/cousin to come with me instead. Then yesterday, he came home all giddy and excited. He told me a buddy of his just called and and invited him to a weekend bachelorâ€™s party this upcoming weekend!!!! ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ðŸŽŠ!!!!! WOW! He is so excited to go!!!!!!!!! Exceptâ€¦the guy heâ€™s going to celebrate is someone he has told me he dislikes on multiple occasions. So he canceled going on a weekend trip with myself and my family because he has to work, but he immediately agrees to go on a bachelorâ€™s trip for someone he *dislikes.* Like he literally chose someone he dislikes over his wife? Maybe Iâ€™m the one he dislikes.\n\nI am not sure if Iâ€™m being ridiculous about why I want to leave, but I now no longer care. Iâ€™m indescribably unhappy in this marriage and itâ€™s time for me to make a plan and get out. I still feel like Iâ€™m young enough that I am not starting completely over, and Iâ€™m very thankful we donâ€™t have children. I feel relieved that itâ€™s going to end now. I feel guilty for feeling this way, but itâ€™s just the truth.",
