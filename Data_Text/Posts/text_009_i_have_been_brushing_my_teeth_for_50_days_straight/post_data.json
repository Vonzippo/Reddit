Most evenings I completed my dental hygiene while watching television or browsing something on my tablet, I simply utilized an app to prompt me and transformed it into a personal challenge to not skip a single day.\n\nI have absolutely no one to share this milestone with, so I'm hoping to celebrate this moment with all of you wonderful people!"
