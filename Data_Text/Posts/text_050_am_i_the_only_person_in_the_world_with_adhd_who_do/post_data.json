  "selftext": "I'll often be seeking advice on how to get things done a bit more efficiently, or how to more readily and easily get into \"the zone\" when I'm working on something important, and everyone I talk to swears by the Pomodoro technique. I've tried it a few times, but since I have difficulty with transitions (big ADHD symptom!) I find that it burns me out faster because I keep having to switch between working and not working in such short periods of time one after the other. And if I do get in \"the zone\" during one of the working times, the alarm throws me off and I end up back where I started whether I take the scheduled break or not. ",
