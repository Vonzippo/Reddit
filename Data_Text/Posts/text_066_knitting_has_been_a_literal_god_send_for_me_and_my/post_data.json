  "selftext": "I learned to knit on a whim 15 years ago this month. (Itâ€™s funny because I was officially diagnosed this year in my mid-30s) Like so many, I have a habit of picking up hobbies and putting them down never to be done again, but with knitting it was and is SO SO different. Knitting touches something in my brain: I just feel so good and it helps me concentrate whether it's a movie, show, lecture, sermon, or just keeping me as close to the present as possible. Or I can daydream if I want ðŸ˜† I take it with me to coffee shops, hang with friends or waiting for an appointment. \n\nAll I know is that knitting helps calm my anxiety and scratches the deep parts in my brain where I feel a sense of pleasure, accomplishment, creativity, and optimism whether I finish a piece or not! Just wanted to share if youâ€™re looking for your next hobby! FYI: it became automatic after a several months to a year of consistent practice. \n\nImage Description: first photo: picture of me on the right in a self-made green tweed textured knit with a friend on my left in a Christmas themed dress.
