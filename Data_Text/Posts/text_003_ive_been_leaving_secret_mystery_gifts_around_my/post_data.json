  "selftext": "A month ago, I was feeling a bit down about all the negativity in the world. So, I decided to try a little experiment in spreading joy. I started leaving small, wrapped gifts in random spots around my neighborhood - nothing expensive, just little trinkets or handmade items.Each gift has a tag that says, \"A surprise for you! Open me :)\" and inside, there's a note encouraging the finder to either keep the gift if it brings them joy or pass it on to someone who might need a smile.\n\nThe results have been amazing:\n\n1. I've seen people's faces light up when they find a gift. There's this moment of childlike wonder that's beautiful to witness.\n2. Our neighborhood Facebook group is buzzing with posts about these \"mystery gifts.\" People are sharing photos and stories about where they found them.\n3. Some folks have started adding to the gifts before passing them on. A small notebook I left now has encouraging messages from multiple people.\n4. I overheard two elderly neighbors bonding over their \"gift-finding adventures\" while taking walks.\n5. A local coffee shop has set up a \"Kindness Corner\" where people can leave or take small gifts, inspired by this trend.\n\nThe best part? I've noticed others starting to leave gifts too. It's like this little ripple of kindness is spreading through our community.It's reminded me how small acts can make a big difference. Has anyone else tried something like this?",
