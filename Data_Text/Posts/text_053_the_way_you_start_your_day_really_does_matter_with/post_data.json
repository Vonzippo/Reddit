Used the op to grab lunch (I work from home). Didn't touch my phone. Took a walk.\n\nThen sat down to work immediately as I got home, no phone, no TV. Baby I did overtime. Ten hours in, I'm calling it a day so I can make dinner.\n\nWhat's different? I didn't doomscroll on my phone for 2-3-4 hours this morning.\n\nNow I don't even have the energy to doomscroll. I'm actually bout to maybe even watch a movie? Long-form, yes!\n\nI still forgot to take the laundry out of the drier and respond to friends, but no wet laundry in the washer.\n\nI'm wondering how much of my adhd is literally made 70% worse because of social media and youtube. I usually wake up groggy and then just watch shit for hours... because I can. And then I feel absolutely drained the rest of the day because I feel like I left all my focus online.\n\nI wish I had a morning appointment for... something, every day. Reminds me of why my mornings were so much better when I was chasing the school bus",
