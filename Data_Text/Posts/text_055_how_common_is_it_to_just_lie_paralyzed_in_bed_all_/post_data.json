  "selftext": "I feel like I ruin my days off because all I can manage to do is lie in bed and look at my phone.\n\nMeanwhile I'm thinking about the things I should/could be doing, can't force myself to get up, progressively feeling guiltier and guiltier. By the time I get up the day is half wasted.\n\nAt this point I look forward to work just because it pushes me to do shit and holds me accountable. Plus it makes me get up at 5:30. Anyway, how many of us deal with something like this?",
