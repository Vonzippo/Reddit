  "selftext": "In the span of a month, two Hilton Head Middle School teachers — Mardy Burleson and Kathleen Harper — have sued Hilton Head resident David Cook for defamation, alleging he called them “groomers”. \n\nOne of the teachers claims they were harassed by the parent because they did not support the removal of over 90 books from the school library that the parent thought were pornographic. The other claim comes from a teacher who was harassed by the parent because they taught the class about modern-day slavery.\n\nPersonally, I hope they take the parent for all their worth. It's ridiculous that a teacher can't talk about the ills that are in the world today that need to be addressed with their students. And let's be honest, most the books that they pull from libraries and school libraries are not at all pornographic or inappropriate. Hell, the Bible has more sex, incest, and murder in it than most those books that parents claim are inappropriate.\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/second-hilton-head-teacher-sues-152824143.html",
