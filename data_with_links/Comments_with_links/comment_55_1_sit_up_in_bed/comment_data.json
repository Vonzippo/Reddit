  "body": "1) Sit up in bed when your alarm goes off. Yes, it sucks, but it’s better than oversleeping and being late.\n\n2) Try to go to sleep and wake up at the same times to condition your body to be awake when you need to be.\n\n3) Set multiple alarms in the morning to time the things you have to do. Example - 7:00 to wake up, 7:10 get dressed, 7:15 brush teeth and do skincare, 7:30 grab lunch from the fridge, 7:35 out the door. Do not deviate unless you truly have to. Remembered you need to start the washer? It can wait. Need to grab the mail? It can wait. \n\n4) Do as much as you can the night before. Lay out your clothes, pack your lunch, set your skincare stuff on the counter. Keep the morning as simple as possible.\n\n5) Do the same routine every morning. ADHD thrives in routines if we can stay in them.\n\n6) For the first few weeks, plan to get there 15 minutes early (at least). Adjust as you get more used to it.\n\n7) If you can simulate the traffic conditions before you actually start (if you’re not working right now), do a practice run to get an idea of how traffic will be.\n\n8) Have a go to hairstyle if your hair isn’t cooperating. A ponytail is good and quick.",
