  "body": "Prepay the ADHD tax. I've seen it on here a couple of times since, but that was one that was a true revelation for me when I saw it first. \n\nIf you don't eat vegetables when they're not chopped, stop buying nonchopped veggies. $2 more for chopped broccoli that you actually eat is still more cost efficient than broccoli that goes directly in the trash. Pay for the app that effectively reminds you to pay your bills instead of paying the penalty for a late bill. Pay for a laundry service instead of buying new underwear when you run out or having your laundry constantly smell because you forget it. \n\nThe ADHD guilt convinces us that it's absolutely \\*ridiculous\\* to buy preboiled eggs or pay for a house cleaner, but if you can afford it and it leads to you having a more proteiny, healthy, clean life, fuckin go for it and stop feeling guilty. I haven't used any garlic other than squeeze garlic for weeks now, but I've cooked things and used garlic, so I don't give a shit.",
