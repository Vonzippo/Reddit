  "body": "Oy. \n\nFor me, it's triggering because I most likely **didn't forgot** to begin with. Whether it's consciously in my mind or not, I've been stressing from the moment I knew I had I needed to do it. And It's been in the back of my mind nagging, guilting, and shaming me since the moment I procrastinated (or did legit forget).\n\nAnd, on top of that, every reminder of something I need to do or didn't do just stresses me out more. It doesn't help to hear it. Again, I know I need to do something, reminding me ONLY makes me feel more overwhelmed, it does nothing to push me to accomplish that task.\n\nObviously, as well, if there is some accusation of laziness, I will get defensive, because it's not true.\n\nSO, when I hear that voice in my head for the millionth time, but from a person, I can tend to snap. \"I know!\" Sadly... ðŸ˜¥",
