I struggle with trusting people, and it takes a long time to earn my trust, but she managed to do it.\n\nI designed and stitched the gift myself. It is full of little easter eggs between her and I. When I gave it to her today, she teared up and took a moment to compose herself before she cried. I was hoping to get it done so that I could give it to her today because I go into surgery tomorrow and it'll be my eighth time under the knife.\n\nThe surgery is low risk but never zero. In case my luck finally runs out, and something goes awry, I wanted her to know I appreciate everything she's helped me through.",
