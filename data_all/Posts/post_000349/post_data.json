  "selftext": "I was so stressed. I just have to let this out somewhere. \n\nAt some point I logged into my Gmail on my work laptop, and all of my chrome bookmarks were imported. \n\nI enjoy wholesome amateur pornography created by real couples, where you can tell they actually love each other and are enjoying themselves. At some point, I bookmarked a redtube link with a title like, “super real and authentic”.\n\nOn Monday, I was attempting to find a public records link for work with a similar name, like “supervisor,” but clicked on that link and suddenly saw Redtube on my work laptop.\n\nI screamed out loud. I deleted the bookmark and my browsing history.\n\nThe next day, I got a Teams invite for a meeting with management for Thursday (today.)\n\nWe had the meeting today, it was an annual performance review and I did fine, there were no issues; if the IT guys saw that, they did not rat me out. \n\nI haven’t been this relieved since the moment I gave birth.",
