  "selftext": "I've been diagnosed with ADHD on four separate occasions. Because the most recent diagnosis was 8 years, 3 relocations, and 1 federally convicted psychiatrist ago, I don't have the documents to prove my diagnosis, and must get re-diagnosed to receive treatment.\n\nWell, according to my psychiatric results, my below-average processing speed/working memory aren't severe enough to indicate a disorder. There are, apparently, signs I exaggerated my symptoms on my self-report. My previously claimed diagnoses are are doubtful, because I never provided them (he didn't ask.)\n\nAppearing mentally present (despite my mind wandering to the furthest reaches of the galaxy) has become second nature to me, which, despite me saying as much, was still misconstrued as showing my full, undivided attention for the duration of the session. Could a bitch with ADHD do that?\n\nMy memory recall is at a severe deficit, which is, in his words, \"just a part of who you are that you have to learn to live with.\"\n\nWhen I asked for advice on remaining employable (I frequently forget deadlines, reports, requests, and struggle to follow instructions) I was told \"it's a pretty big change, but it may be worth considering being a housewife like your mom.\"\n\nGlad to know that in today's world, it's a better idea to just be a housewife than to get treatment for disability.",
