Suddenly, he needed detailed instructions for **everything** (well, except his job, of course, god forbid he's look incompetent in front of his boss or male colleagues) and my friend gradually became very angry and frustrated with their whole situation. I know a lot of us can relate to a situation when you are forced to \"manage\" not only yourself, but also another adult and how taxing mentally it feels.\n\nYesterday she called me laughing hysterically, saying she finally found a way to show him how dumb he looks asking for \"lists and instructions\" with the most basic everyday tasks.\n\nHe was asking for sex that night and she simply said \"Okay, just make me a list of what I need to do!\". Apparently, he thought it's a game, wrote \"give me a blowjob\" on a sticky note and put in on his chest.\n\nBut she calmly proceeded with \"Oh, idk, it sounds so complicated! How about you just tell me exactly what I need to do? It's your penis after all and you know it better than me!\". \n\nHe kept going and said \"Okay, you take it in your hand...\" and she interrupted with \"Do I need to use my right hand or left hand? I think it's important, I don't want to mess up anything!\" and at that moment he just angrily stomped out of the bedroom üòÇ Ladies, I WOULD DIE for a chance to be there and see his face at that moment! \n\nAnd while she was telling me all this on the phone he apparently went grocery shopping without her reminding him about it. And didn't ask for a list or shop's detailed layout!\n\nI'm so happy she finally realised she can be this petty when he doesn't do his fair share of household and childcare tasks. ",
