  "selftext": "Hi team. A few days ago, another adhd-er posted about procrastination and I replied with a comment about how I’d had a dress in the laundry hamper for six years. The comment got 1.4K likes and at last count over 60 comments, all commiserating and adding similar stories.\n\nI wrote that as an undiagnosed onlooker and everything I read was insanely validating and comforting. I was formally diagnosed (big fecking surprise) an hour ago with the good old inattentive-hyperactive combination. I’m one of you! Thank you for all the comments on that other post, it gave me so much confidence going into my appointment today 🫶🏼",
