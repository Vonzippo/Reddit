  "selftext": "My son was only 7 years old when he took a picture of his little sister on his new tablet. He noticed something. He has always hyper fixated on patterns, or differences in things. This has had its ups and downs. He will ask larger people why they are fat (at 5.5 years old) or point out someone's physical disability. He means well, he is just fascinated and curious. \n\nMy daughter was diagnosed with retinoblastoma because of this picture, alone. She had her 3 year well child visit less than 2 months prior to her diagnosis.\n\nShe had an enucleation, and having told the surgeon and eye specialist the story of why she was diagnosed, said to tell my 7 year old son he saved his little sister's life. She was in tears when she told me the tumor was a mere 1-2 mm ( THATS MILLIMETERS Y'ALL) from spreading to her brain via her optic nerve. \n\nShe is now 6 years old, and in 1st grade. Her brother still  has his little sister, and he is my super hero, forever!!\n",
