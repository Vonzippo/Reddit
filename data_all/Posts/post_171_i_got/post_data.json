  "selftext": "Over the course of the last few months I worked with a psychologist that specializes in ADHD. We had an intake appointment, and assessment, and then a follow up today. She presented her findings to me today, and she does not think I have ADHD. She told me that I have *severe* anxiety, way worse than I realized. So bad that it impacts my cognitive functioning, to a degree. I know I’m an anxious person and I have been my whole life, but it never occurred to me that it’s *that* bad. Apparently it is. She also mentioned that I did not seem to have any childhood ADHD symptoms which I wholeheartedly disagree with, but I was too thrown off during the appointment to mention that.\n\nThe doctor still wants to have me try stimulant medication, which is a relief because anxiety and depression medication have barely worked for me.\n\nBut I feel even more lost now. And kind of ashamed for thinking so strongly that it *was* ADHD. I truly feel like an impostor. Is it weird to be disappointed? I’ve had all this anxiety my entire life, but none of the treatments I have tried have helped, **or** made the ADHD-related symptoms better. This is so disheartening.\n\nShould I follow up with the psychologist? Should I reiterate the focus and procrastination issues I struggled with as a child? Part of me wants to just drop this and disappear into a hole. I don’t know what to do. This can’t be it. \n\n",
