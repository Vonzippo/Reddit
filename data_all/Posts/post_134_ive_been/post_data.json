Including an ADHD diagnoses and medication. I planed the wedding of my dreams. My soul dog of 11 years had their paw print on our wedding certificate. \nEight months later my dog dies. \nThirteen months after my wedding I find my spouse is cheating on me with the very one person who always made me feel uncomfortable. Every single fight was able this person… I knew all along but was convinced he was right; I was CRAZY. \nI am so embarrassed that I had this huge fun amazing wedding. I’m ashamed I was manipulated into thinking I was the problem and didn’t have the guys to stand up for myself. I have no idea what to do. They were who I pictured I would grow old with. They did the finances for us, so I feel infantile not knowing how to handle my fiancés. I don’t know how to take care of myself right now. And no, before you ask, there is no one I can call. \n\nMost of all I just want to fall asleep when they were the spouse my my dreams, I knew nothing, and never ever wake up again. \n",
