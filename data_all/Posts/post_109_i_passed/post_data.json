  "selftext": "Hi everyone! I DID IT Y’ALL!!!\nMaybe you saw one or both of my previous posts, there’s [the first one](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/s/NCxqvOC6PV) where I despaired and felt hopeless because I was unable to study and felt truly miserable, and then there’s [the one where I became a study streamer to motivate myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/s/bU1jVyJl8C) and asked for motivation and hype so I could get through those last agonizing weeks. \n\nWell, after all of that, I felt like it’s only fair to come here and give you guys an update! I DID IT! I DID THE THING. I PASSED THE EXAM. I’LL BECOME AN ATTORNEY. I honestly thought it was impossible for me. During all of my law school years I clapped at cheered at people passing this degree exam every week and I thought that popping champagne moment would never come for me. [But it did happen](https://imgur.com/a/LOPBd0m) and I’m really so, SO glad it’s over.\n\n>!I never post myself on reddit but i’m happy and idc. ALSO Yes I got kinda depressed and angry at myself after the exam bc I didn’t get the best grade possible and I’ll never know if it would’ve been possible for me to get it had I studied properly and not put myself through this shit ordeal to begin with, but I know that doesn’t really matter anymore and it never did tbh being a perfectionist sucks and actually takes you FURTHER AWAY FROM “PERFECTION” IT RUINS YOUR LIFE DON’T DO IT!<\n\nI can’t believe it, truly, like, I thought there was a limit to what last-minute-energy and ADHD hyperfixation could achieve. I’m sure there IS a limit, but I haven’t reached it yet, so it’s fine I guess. Surely, this doesn’t set the best precedent ever, and I’ll have to remind myself of how awful these weeks of intense cramming were every time I think *“oh, it’s gonna be fine, I did manage to do that one extremely crazy thing in an unbelievably short amount of days that one time, I’m sure I can do it again”,* but that’s a future me problem, I guess. Never doubt what a crazy lady with legal medical access to amphetamines can achieve. \n\nI just really wanted to come here and show you all, I’m so grateful for the support I constantly get from this sub. Not only because I really got fired up and motivated from that post and from my study-streamer shenanigans, but also because this group of women with similar funny brain things as me really, really makes me feel less alone and less inadequate in this really unfriendly world. Thank you all, you’re all great! \n\nI’ll \tleave you with the one thing I told myself almost daily to get through this (I even had this written on my wall):\n\n• *I CAN do this, not because I’m extremely smart or a perfect student, but because I’m absolutely fucking insane.*\n\n\n**TOODLE-OO!**\n\n",
