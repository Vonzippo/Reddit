  "selftext": "I have a week off of work and so being out of my regular routine has my brain too much time and space to resist doing anything essential. I have been missing meals (accidentally), not going to use the toilet and then having a very sore stomach after I finally urinate and  I have really fought with myself this week to try and clean my room. Today, I took the steps towards doing so and even though I still have lots to do, I have felt so proud of myself for getting up and spending 45 mins uninterrupted tackling my room. This evening i was somewhat politely met by my parent, highliting other tasks around the house I need to keep on top of. I know it shouldn't get to me but when you have been fighting your brain for an entire week and finally make some progress, being reminded of the other ways in which you have fallen short of other's expectations and standards, hurts ***a lot.*** I don't want to catastrophise but it makes you realise how much of a deficit you experience when dealing with ADHD. Sometimes you just want someone to see the battle going on in your head and to realise that YOU DO NOT MEAN TO BE FORGETFUL, YOU DO NOT MEAN TO BE MESSY, YOU DO NOT MEAN TO BE CHAOTIC AND STAYING ON TOP OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR BRAIN IS WORKING AGAINST YOU IS INDESCRIBABLY DIFFICULT. I really hope someone somewhere can relate to this feeling,",
