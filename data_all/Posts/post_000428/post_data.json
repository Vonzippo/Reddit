  "selftext": "I teach high school, and I have a lot of students planning to join the military. Usually they are the ones with little to no work ethic, and who mouth off to me constantly. Now, I'm not a fan of the military-industrial complex, but I'm pretty sure that disrespecting your superiors and refusing to do any work are not really how they do things in the armed forces! \n\nI wish I could be a fly on the wall when these kids enter basic and get their little asses handed to them. Truthfully, I am in a rural area and I think a lot of these kids think that being a gun nut is the only qualification required.",
