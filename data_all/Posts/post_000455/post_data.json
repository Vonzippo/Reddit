  "selftext": "Just found out that my younger sister who has autism (maybe at a 4th grade level in all subjects) is pregnant due in April. Disappeared from home (was living a couple doors down from parents in a small condo) in January with an internet boyfriend. Blocked all of us, (we are evil according to her. Anyone who has tried to help her grow in the right direction is) but I found who she’s with and where she’s living the next day. I begged my parents for years to get a hysterectomy done while they had the chance. Her sexuality has always been turned fully on.\n\nShe can’t live independently or properly care for her own self, drive, know if she got the right change back from a store clerk. Her dental hygiene is so bad that her teeth are falling out in combination with lifelong thumb sucking. Constant kidney infections from poor hygiene downstairs. Found this out via the boyfriend’s, mom’s Facebook. So much backstory that I can’t share it all, but it’s just so sad. At least she’ll have the help of the mom. ",
