She told him he'll never find someone better than me at this job (boss told me all this after their meeting).\n\n  \nI've struggled so much in my life dealing with ADHD. I've thought about posting here so many times but I always get distracted and forget what point I'm trying to make, or I just get tired and sad putting my struggles into writing. Most day's I'm thinking about how debilitating my ADHD is and being sad I can't live up to my own expectations. Today isn't one of those days! Through all my struggles, I've gained an immense amount of empathy and I take pride in being able to connect and relate to others. My friends and family know I'm the person they can rely on when shit hits the fan. To be recognized this way in a work environment means so much to me. I'll probably happy cry about it later. Anyway... thanks for listening :)",
