  "selftext": "So, here’s what happened: I took my golden retriever, Max, to the dog park yesterday, as usual. He’s a social butterfly, so I let him off-leash to run around with the other dogs. When it was time to go, I spotted him by the water bowl, called him over, and he happily trotted up. I leashed him, said bye to a few dog park regulars, and headed home.\n\nIt wasn’t until I got inside that I realized... this wasn’t Max. The dog I brought home looked almost identical, but was a bit too hyper, and had a weird fascination with my cat, which Max usually ignores. After a brief moment of panic, I checked the tag—and yep, totally different dog.\n\nTurns out, his owner had already noticed the switch and was frantically looking around the park. I rushed back with \"Not-Max,\" and we had a good laugh about it once we sorted it out. Anyone else have one of those “I can’t believe this just happened” moments lately?",
