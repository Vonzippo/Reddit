  "selftext": "I got this journal as a birthday present from my SO and it has chabed my life. It is travelers style with the elastic bands from Paper republic so you can make it as chunky as you want. I even put a word searcher in it 🥰 So I have entertainment on the go. Currently waiting for another calendar 2025 insert that is coming in the mail soon. The leather ages with time and you'll get a beautiful patina. \n\nTo anyone wondering it's from Paper republic and it's a Grand Voyageur in XL in chestnut. And had it embossed with my name 🥰\n\nI love the pocket insert you can get 🥰",
