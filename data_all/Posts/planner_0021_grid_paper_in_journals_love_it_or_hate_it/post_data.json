  "selftext": "How do you all feel about using grid paper in your journals? Personally, I’m not a big fan, but it’s the only way I can get myself to write consistently. Blank pages just make me want to doodle or sketch instead of actually writing, so the grid keeps me focused. I’m torn because I love my big notebook and its quality, but those squares… not so much.\n\nDo you guys like using grid paper? Can you tolerate it, or do you prefer something else entirely? Let me know!",
