  "selftext": "I started typing out the whole long-ass story but honestly I’m sick of talking about it. I came downstairs and found him down and mostly unresponsive but breathing on his own. He stopped breathing while I was waiting for the ambulance (rural area) so I started CPR but I knew it was useless. He was only 57. \n\nWhat I want to get off my chest is, I’m glad. He has been nothing but an emotional and financial burden for the past 5 years and financially he continues to be a burden from beyond the grave, as he was up to *shenanigans*. He’s spent everything and owes everyone. I did my best to help him but for fucks sake. Ofc I cried and so forth and we did have an excellent marriage for the first 15 years. But in the evenings as I sit in my clean, rearranged den with my dogs and my cats, browsing the internet and listening to music, I feel peaceful for the first time in 5 years. ",
