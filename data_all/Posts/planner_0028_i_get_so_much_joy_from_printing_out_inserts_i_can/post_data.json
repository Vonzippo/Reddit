  "selftext": "It's stormy today, so perfect day to print inserts for 2025. I started feeling an itch to perhaps change something, or everything, but today I decided to do what I vowed to do with the printer I got last year - print inserts. Design and print dashboards. I did some tests for dashboard, and printed majority of the calendar inserts - monthlies and weeklies. Somehow despite printing the exact same inserts that I used last year, I felt such joy. I use ivory Tomoe River 68gsm paper, and the result is just pretty and luxurious. I did buy a cornell notes printable for â‚¬1.58 but using what I have is actually very cool. ðŸ˜€",
