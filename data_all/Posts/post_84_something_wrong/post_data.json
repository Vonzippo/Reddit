  "selftext": "I have a wonderful, very high-energy labrador. I noticed lately that he doesn't really respond when I say, \"Want to go for a walk?\" or \"Do you want to play?\" or any other exciting thing. He 100% knows what those things mean!! But he just keeps laying there in his little donut shape, staring up at me. Sometimes he even sighs. \n\nIt's a little concerning, so I started paying more attention to our interactions / the things he DOES respond to. If I ask him to go for a walk, he doesn't move! But if he hears his collar jingle, suddenly he's up like a ROCKET and racing towards the front door? \n\n... Anyways. I realized, after a bit of investigation, that the reason he doesn't react to my exciting questions is because: I ask him, do you want to go for a walk? Then on my way to the front door, I start doing the dishes. Then I ask, ok NOW let's go for a walk! And I head to the bedroom to lay out some fresh clothes for after the walk. Then I say, ok NOW let's walk! And I start picking up the toys he had on the floor. Then I say, ok WALK TIME! And then I decide to just carry that small stack of extra toiletries to the basement. \n\nAnd THEN I grab his collar, and he hears it jingle, and he's at the door.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with my dog. I have essentially trained my dog to know that I'm full of shit, and when I say I'm going to do something, I will probably get distracted with other tasks for 30+ minutes before ACTUALLY doing that thing, and he doesn't even bother getting up. When he hears the collar jingle, he knows it IS walk time. \n\nADHD, or as it is now known in this house, A Disappointed Hound Disorder.",
