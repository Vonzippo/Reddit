  "selftext": "I didn’t notice I was doing this until just a few years ago, but looking back, I think I’ve always done it in times of stress.\n\nIn my junior year of high-school I developed hiccups that would only come one at a time, but it would happen 40-50 times a day. I asked doctors about it anytime I needed to see one, and none of them seemed concerned and they never really gave me any insight into why it would be happening.\n\nIn my 20’s I found yoga. If you’re not familiar, focusing on your breath is a very large part of it. I noticed my hiccups subsided dramatically when I was actively practicing.\n\nFast forward to my late 30’s, our current timeline, and I am stressed to the max. I brought up to my husband a few weeks ago that I could notice I was holding my breath more, and he asked me to elaborate. After I explained, he confessed that he had noticed me doing this and was worried about why it was happening.\n\nI share this in this sub in hopes of confirming that other women do this with adhd, or finding out that i need to look into this more. I’m sure it’s not healthy, so please don’t come to this thread to scare me, I’m already scared. I’m aware it’s a problem and this is part of my journey in finding out why it happens. \n\nThis is there first step in my seeking help for this, so don’t tell me to ask a doctor. I will.\n",
