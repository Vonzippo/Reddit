  "selftext": "I have seen five therapists in the past seven years, and all have been a bad experiences. I’ve felt unheard, misunderstood, and invalidated repeatedly. I often spend the session trying to explain myself or arguing with them in some capacity. One therapist finally sent me to a psychiatrist to discuss my depression medication and the psychiatrist diagnosed me with ADHD. I saw him for six weeks and he was able to explain things to me in a way that made perfect sense. Every session I had with him was life changing. Looking back, I’m pretty sure he was neurodivergent and all therapists I’ve seen are neurotypical. Below are a list of things he said that really helped me: \n\nOn Middle Age:\nMiddle age women want easy relationships so they can grow and become who they are meant to be. \n\nEveryone in their 40s goes through this “is this all there is” phase—sometimes for the rest of your life. When you reach your goals you see things differently and wonder what all the hustling was about. Like, I’ve done all that, now what? Did any of it matter?\n\nOn Midlife Crisis: \nA lot of people go through midlife crisis for 6months-2 years in their 40s were another side of them comes out. It’s not insanity, it’s just another side of them that has been hiding. Sometimes they snap out of it and return, but they can’t undo what’s been done and what everyone has seen—their other side is there and it may come back, and it may stay.\nWhat to do: Think about what do you want with the rest of your life? How do you want it to look?\n\nOn Mothering and Responsibility: \nWhen you weren’t mothered well it is very scary to be a mother, because you don’t know what to do and you feel very responsible for everything. The responsibility you feel for them is love.\n\nOn Childhood Neglect:\nYou felt neglected as a child, but someone always had their eyes on you—someone was always looking out for you. Neighbors, siblings, friends, relatives, teachers; there were others watching over you. Even though it wasn’t your parents, it wasn’t who you wanted, there were people there. \n\nOn Aging Parents:\nIf you don’t want to be a caretaker for your parents, don’t be. Don’t do what you’re not good at or don’t want to. Be the overseer, the manager. Pick your role and be good at it and delegate the rest out to the village, to social programs. Figure out your role and do it well so you do not feel guilt or overwhelm. \n\nTaking care of your parents will be almost like raising kids—the amount of work will overwhelm you if you don’t have a plan. \n\nOn In-Law Family Responsibility: \nYou’re in charge of your people (family/friends) he’s in charge of his—in regard to family drama, emotional needs, troubles between you and in-laws, gifts.\n\nOn Covert Narcissists: \nThese people will flock to you. A quick way to see them is to ask yourself this question “do they put themselves at the center of every tragedy”? \n\nYour childhood taught you how to handle people like this and take care of yourself. You get to decide the relationship, you are in charge of how you want to show up and how you want this story to be told. You teach your children how to handle people like this by how you behave. \n\nThink of how do you want this relationship to look big picture, how do you want your kids to remember it? \n\n\n\nThese notes may be really basic to others, idk, but they really helped me see the world more clearly. I have more, if you are interested :)",
