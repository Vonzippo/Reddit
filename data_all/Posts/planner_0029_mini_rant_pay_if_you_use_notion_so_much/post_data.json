  "selftext": "i am an avid notion user and i use it every day for 6 years now. i noticed a lot of people complaining about notion, and yes, i 100% understand the points of complain. it still has improvements. \n\nwhat is annoying is that people who use notion for free complains about poor service, they want more space, etc. friend, you are using a product for free. what do you expect. at a supermarket when you get free samples for chips, do you complain that they only give you *some* chips? do you try to fill your stomach up with chips? \n\ndon't be stingy. just pay the notion monthly fee *if* you use and rely on notion so much.\n\ni know this will be a controversial statement, but really tired about the complaints and negativity in this sub.",
