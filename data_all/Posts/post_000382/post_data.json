  "selftext": "So I work as a janitor at an elementary school, and there's this quiet second-grader who always waves at me during lunch cleanup. Today he came up to me with this crayon drawing he made for \"career day.\"It was me. In a cape. With a mop.His teacher told me he wrote that he wants to be \"like Mr. James who makes our school shine and keeps all the germs away so we can learn and play.\" He drew me with massive muscles (I wish!) fighting off what looks like giant green bacteria monsters with my \"super mop of doom\" (his words, not mine).I'm not going to lie, I had to take my \"cleaning break\" a few minutes early because I was tearing up in the hallway. All this time I thought I was just the guy who cleans up spilled milk and mops floors, but in this kid's eyes, I'm literally saving the world every day.The drawing is now hanging in my cleaning supply closet, right next to my \"super mop of doom.\" Every time I see it, it reminds me that even the most ordinary jobs can mean the world to someone.Anyone else ever have a moment where a kid's perspective completely changed how you saw yourself?",
