We use it for three of our companies, and then I personally keep track of some life aspects in it, and I have a free workspace with my partner to share a calendar, track our shopping list, plan trips, etc. We've shown other families and businesses how we use it, we've touted how good it is, and we've been happy\n\n***Note; past tense.***\n\nIf you were not aware; the 'Free' version of Notion gives you 1000 'blocks' if the workspace has more than member - the definition of 'block' always fairly ephemeral, but so be it.

Notion has popped up saying we ran out of blocks. That is odd I though, but I'll go and see if there's anything in the trash we can free up. I go to the trash, having not had to in a while, and there is HEAPS. When I mean heaps, I mean everything we've ever deleted is still in there, going all the way back to the original starter content that we deleted when we first started the workspace. Nothing was ever removed after 30 days. I sat there for nearly an hour all up manually deleting everything one at time, re-launching Notion when it appeared empty, and continuing. Eventually it was actually empty.\n\n***The \"you've used all of this workspace's free blocks\" message persisted though.*** *But why?*\n\nWe had to raise a support ticket in the end. We got it down to what we could count as maybe 150-200 blocks, the support articles still said we should get 1000, the trash was definitely empty, but it would not let us add anything anywhere.\n\nNotion Support confirmed the following two absolute deal-breakers for us;\n\n* You can no longer see how many blocks you are using, it does not give you this information.\n* Deleting items will free up blocks, ***until*** you hit 1,000 blocks. Then deleting items does nothing and you have to remove a member, or pay, to continue using Notion.\n\nSo, we were hit by what looks like a bug where items in our trash never removed themselves. We could not see that more and more blocks were being consumed. Likely related to the trash bug we never got a warning about running out of blocks (unless they just removed that feature too). And then once we had used them all unexpectedly, there was no going back as deleting more items no longer does anything, and you either have to stop using the platform, or give them money.\n\nThe morals and ethics underpinning these design decisions that lead to customers being intentionally mislead into paying are horrendous.\n\nI hope this lesson helps someone else! \n\nTo cite the exact wording from support;\n\n* \"You can no longer view exactly how many blocks are used.\"\n* \"Removing blocks will not increase the number of available blocks.\"\n* \"Deleted blocks effectively reduce the Block Usage on the Free Plan unless you have already reached the 1000 block limit.\" (A different rep in a 2nd ticket, hence alternate wording)",
