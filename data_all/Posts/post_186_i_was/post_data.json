I was told by my husband and his best friend that I am, \"Always in a bad mood, hard to be around, if they say the wrong thing I'll pack up the family and leave.\" everyone thinks I'm scary and that's why no one would ever say anything, they all say it to my husband instead.  The context:  I quit drinking almost 2 years ago.  Alllll of these people who hate me, drink heavily.  I have been forcing myself into ununcomfortable drinking situations and it's led to me being anxious and unable to mask?? Because I am visibly uncomfortable, they are uncomfortable with me being around? No one has ever said ANYTHING to me.  Not, hey are you okay? Is there something wrong? OH YOU QUIT DRINKING, THIS MUST BE WEIRD FOR YOU.  I'm so over all of this superficial relationship mess. On one hand I'm glad for the feedback and on the other I want to disappear from this family.  I try so hard to be aware of myself, my actions, my intent.  And to hear that EVERYONE actually thinks I'm annoying is just great.  ",
