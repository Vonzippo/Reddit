  "selftext": "One year ago i managed to convince my partner we should buy a house and i would restore it myself. Needed new full eletrical and plumbing installations. A load bearing wall to come off and so much more.\nMind you I had never touched a construction tool. I'm a filmmaker. Had absolutely none of the skills necessary and a mental health condition that makes me prone to abandon projects.\nThis week i'm finishing the bathroom (last pictures). After this, the house will be fully usable. I am so tired of showering with cold water, outside with a garden hose. Next i will do the kitchen. \nOther than having a cousin help lifting a concrete beam and my mom and partner help moving debree, i did everything by myself. I am normally very not proud of myself, but currently i am a bit. Just hope i have the mental strength to finish it. I cannot believe my partner went along.\n",
