I was on the other side of the theater but noticed he was on one when I came in. 

It was a pretty big theater and I could see a faint light once the movie started but I kind of thought it was just an aisle light. 

When I went to leave I noticed he was still on it. Took this as the credits rolled. 

Note: he also had earbuds in but took them out right before the picture.
