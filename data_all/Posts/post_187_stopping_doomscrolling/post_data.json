  "selftext": "PSA in response to posts this week\n\n**Stopping doomscrolling is** ***really, really fucking hard*** **with ADHD**, and willpower alone generally isn't enough for us to stop. It's not a personal character flaw. The entire internet these days is optimized to suck our attention through our phones.\n\n**But it's really, really worth it**. I managed to drastically reduce my doomscrolling basically by blocking the hell out of everything bad on the internet. It made my ADHD symptoms and anxiety much better, basically on par with starting to take meds\n\n* I couldn't browse during the workday. I started tasks faster, my job reviews improved, and my work stress went down\n* I couldn't escape to the internet when I felt sad/scared. I started paying more attention to my feelings and my emotional regulation improved. I also started reaching out to my closest friends to talk about what was going on more often, and some of those relationships got deeper and more real\n* I couldn't browse uninterrupted for long enough to get bad hyperfocus (the \"I'm thirsty but can't stop to drink / sleepy but can't go to bed\" kind). My health and fitness improved slightly\n\n**There are tools that make it much easier**. I like OneSec and Apple's Focus settings, and have also heard great things about Freedom and ColdTurkey. Good features:\n\n* A \"hard block\". Use this for apps and websites that you *always regret*, e.g., sewer-quality news or icky porn\n* A \"scheduled block\". Use this for apps and sites that you enjoy but shouldn't visit at work\n   * I also block the whole internet from half an hour before bed until half an hour after wakeup, so I can wind down in the evening, and wake up to sunrise and coffee instead of stressful new alerts\n* A \"limit\". Useful for apps and websites that you enjoy but shouldn't use all day (e.g., reddit, social media)\n* A \"delay\". Use this for apps and websites that you need access to, but should probably only look at occasionally, not in every spare minute\n   * This is an intentionally irritating delay that takes away the dopamine hit from opening an app. Some of them also make you do an annoying task like flipping your phone or solving a slow and boring puzzle. It makes you want to open the app only when you need it, not when you're bored\n   * It's helpful to add an \"interruption\" feature that repeats the delay every 10 minutes or so, in case you get distracted and start doomscrolling once you're in\n\n**You have to make the tools work for you**. It's common to have some challenges and need to customize the settings repeatedly. \n\nIf you block your favorite doomscrolling websites, out of habit you'll probably look for other websites to doomscroll. You'll have to go and block those too.\n\nOccasionally, you'll be locked out of something useful (e.g., new parking meters that have to be paid online, or needing the internet at an odd hour during an emergency). It's helpful to have a loophole - I can unlock everything by going through a really annoying three-minute delay; my boyfriend had me set up a password that he doesn't know but can get from several places if needed.\n\nHonestly, the nuisance of customizing the tools and occasionally having them work wrong is *really, really small* compared to losing hours per day to uncontrolled doomscrolling.\n\nGood luck and DM if you want to try this but need help on the details.\n\n  \n",
