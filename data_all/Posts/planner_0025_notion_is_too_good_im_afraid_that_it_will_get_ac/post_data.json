  "selftext": "Dear notion please don't sell out ðŸ˜­. There is no way you're listening but Ivan Zhao (Founder) and Meagan Kim (user research) please do not sell.\n\nIs it just me or does every new notion release and added bit of functionality make you afraid that they are getting too good and will eventually be acquired. My background is in UX (user experience), I design software for a living and these people are quite simply on an unfathomable winning streak. Companies like Google and Microsoft would probably rather buyout competition as opposed to compete. I feel the dread smothering me like BBQ sauce on baby backs everytime I see these killer new features. I'm worried that the next big step for them is being acquired... I'm not above begging ðŸ˜… please stay independent. \nAnyone else feel the same? \n\nCan we do the equivalent of writing a letter to our senator to make sure they don't get bought, would collecting signatures help, am I off my rocker?",
