  "selftext": "i don’t even live in the states and yet i’ve been constantly scared since november 6th. i feel so deeply for all my afabs and femme presenting people out there over the sea. please stay safe.\ni literally live in europe but the discourse is everywhere so it’s really getting into my head. i don’t even have social media apart from reddit but there’s no escaping. and it’s making me go insane.\n\nand what’s even worse than the men saying it, is the women tweeting it!! i hate hate hate how the patriarchy brainwashed these girls and GROWN women that you do not get a right over your own body. it also seems that these women are mostly white and pretty, who probably never experienced rape or domestic violence in their lives. perhaps they did, but it sure looks like they didn’t. it’s pure privilege speaking.\n\n\ni have been unpacking my childhood and adult sa lately after years of repressing and this just keeps hitting me in the face. it was my body, his choice, so many times. it had always been until i opened my eyes and stood up for myself. the fact that this rhetoric is being spread ON THE INTERNET WITHOUT SHAME, is making me cry. i feel sick to my stomach most of the time. i am genuinely so scared of getting raped again. i don’t know how to look at men casually walking on the street without wanting to run away. \ni know a lot of you probably feel the same way and especially to the people living in the usa, i’m so sorry and i hope you stay safe. learn to use a weapon if you must. do whatever you need to to protect yourselves from these absolute morons. \n\nit will ALWAYS be your body, your choice. forever.
