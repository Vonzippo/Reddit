  "selftext": "While on a lunch break at work a few months back, I wanted to do some sketches and had some PVC canvas off-cut strips lying around and used one to draw on. When i finished up i rolled it up and made a quick belt for it to keep it tight . Fast forward to now, I do most of my notebooking and sketches on these scrolls when im out and about.  I still love my notebooks, but it's a unique and fun experience to write on something different for a change.",
