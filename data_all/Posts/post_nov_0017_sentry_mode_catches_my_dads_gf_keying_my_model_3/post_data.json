  "selftext": "So I was getting ready to leave from visiting my father who’s battling pancreatic cancer. And upon getting into my car I got a notification that sentry mode had captured a new event. Which was weird because I was loading luggage into my car the whole time so I figured it was only that. But to my surprise the video shows my dad’s GF keying my Model 3 from front to back. So after watching the video I confronted her and of course she lies to my face, proceeds to tell me how she has no respect for me and then if that wasn’t enough attacks me! I had to file a police report against her for battery and vandalism. And Lord knows how much the damages will total as the scratches are from the driverside headlight all the way to the back of the car and across the back bumper. I just pray I can recover the full cost for the damages from her and I hope serves time/is held accountable for her actions.\n",
