So when I was having what I thought was a sincere conversation with a new friend and he then told me he likes to play “Devil’s Advocate” I didn’t even stutter to ask him not to. I told him that I and many others will take him at his word and believe that he believes what he says. And I told him that it can be cruel to tell people who have been harmed in the past things that he doesn’t believe. It’s a shitty thing to do, because you could be re-traumatizing someone, and not even believe the point you’re making. \n\nBut now I’m feeling bad and worried that I stepped on him by standing up for myself. I tried to not shut him down and said that I’m always down to have theoretical conversations. But I feel like I always second guess myself after conversations that aren’t just total head-nodding agreement. \n\nThought I’d ask any similar-brained folks what they thought - do you have a hard time with people playing devils advocate? Do you second guess yourself after serious conversations??",
