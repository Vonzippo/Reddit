  "selftext": "My partner/friend that live with me leave for work before I do and this morning they left around 7:30 as usual. For the next 2 hours my cat was screaming at me nonstop and I couldn't figure out why. She kept leading me into the kitchen but I thought she was just trying to get me to feed her again even though I knew my partner had already fed her. \n\nFinally when I was starting to prep my breakfast and she was still standing there crying at me I noticed the smell of natural gas and immediately looked at our stove to see one of the knobs was a little past the off orientation but was unlit. Ended up airing the place out for 20 minutes and all was fine and my cat stopped crying immediately after. \n\nJust wanted to share her story cuz she's the best girl ever and she's gonna get lots of treats for saving me from blowing up this morning. Trust your animals folks they know when something is wrong. ",
