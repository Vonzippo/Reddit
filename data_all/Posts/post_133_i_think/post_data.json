  "selftext": "I was talking to my therapist of like 10 plus years. I was explaining that almost every task I do requires some form of mental effort, kind of like buffering. For example, if I need to pee I don't just get up and go, it is a back and forth in my brain and is sometimes quite difficult to get up and go. I said that I assume everyone has this to some extent, and that I just wish I didn't have that buffering for everything in my life. She seemed baffled, that it shouldn't be like that if I am not depressed, and that she had to think about what I said because she didn't know how to help me. I got the impression that I am the only one experiencing this. \n\nAm I? Do any of you experience internal difficulties doing things? It feels like an ADHD thing (which she knows I have... And she has too) but her reaction really made me feel alone and now I am worried I am the only person experiencing this. \n\nAlso, anon because I am embarrassed. I have been a part of this group forever and respect ya'lls opinions. ",
